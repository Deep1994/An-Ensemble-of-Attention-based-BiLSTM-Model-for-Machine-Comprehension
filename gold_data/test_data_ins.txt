0	getting the newspaper	Early this morning I woke up to the sound of my newspaper landing on my driveway. I sat up and wrapped my pink robe around me. I slipped my feet into my slippers and looked at the clock. It was only 7:00 but it was time for me to get my newspaper and drink some coffee. I looked out the window and noticed it was raining quite a bit. I saw the newspaper at the end of my driveway, as far away as it could be. I grabbed my umbrella out of my coat closet and opened my front door enough to stick the umbrella through and open it outside. I stepped out the door and quickly covered my head with the umbrella. Then I ran to the end of my driveway, scooped up the newspaper in its plastic wrapping, and ran back to my front door. I closed my umbrella, took off my slippers, and dried off. Then, I unwrapped my newspaper and sat down to read it.
1	setting the dining table	First, we clear everything off the dining table that isn't related to dinner, such as crayons and papers and computers.  Then, we count how many people are going to come to dinner. Tonight, there is Mom, and Dad, and Grandma, and Grandpa, and Tom, and the Baby. So, we are having five people, and one person in the high chair. Then, we go get the five placemats out of the side cabinet. After we set the placemats neatly at chair. After we set a placemat at each chair, we go get the plates. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all get big plates, but Tom is still little, so he gets a small plastic plate. We set a plate on each placemat. Now we need a napkin for each place. Luckily, we still have some napkins left over from the birthday party last week, so we will use those. It doesn't matter that they say "Happy Birthday." We put a folded napkin to the left side of each plate. On top of each napkin we put a fork. Except for Tom, he gets a small fork. On the right side of the plate we put a knife and spoon. We need to be careful with the knives. Closer to the center of the table we put a glass by each plate. Tom gets a plastic glass, because he isn't ready for a real glass one yet. We are ready to eat!
2	visiting the beach	We look out the window and discover it is a bright sunny day, which is perfect for going to the beach. We load up the car with all sorts of beach things: buckets, shovels, beach chairs, towels, and an umbrella. We also pack a lunch in the cooler. Everyone in the family puts on their swimsuits and sunscreen. We drive to the beach, and we all unload the car and walk to the beach. We set up on the beach, with our chairs and the umbrella. Mom reads her book in the chair and hangs out with the baby, while Dad takes the older kids swimming. They are very careful to not go in the water too deep. After a while, Mom goes swimming, and Dad builds sand castles with the kids. We eat lunch, and then we shower at the some of the showers near the parking lot. We load all the towels, and buckets, and shovels back into the car, and we drive home.
3	taking a driving lesson	Yesterday, I had my first driving lesson. My mother told me it was time for me to learn, so we both got into the car, and drove to a part of my neighborhood that was sort of empty. There were not a lot of people living in this section, so it was more of a big area for me to practice. We got to the area, and we both got out of the car and switched seats. It felt very cool finally being in front of a steering wheel. I released the emergency brake, and put the car in drive, and did what my mom told me to do. We mainly drove around in circles and practiced driving in straight lines and making turns. After a few minutes practicing my turns, I put the car in reverse and practiced backing up. I made sure to look behind me to see if there was anyone, just so I knew it was safe. It felt very cool to have finally driven a car, and my mom told me how good of a job I did.
4	making soup	Soup is my favorite thing to eat, no matter what time of year it is. Today, I decided I wanted to make some stuffed belle pepper soup. I made my grocery list and headed out to gather all of the ingredients I needed. I came home and got started right away, since I was excited. First, I chopped my onion and put it into the big pot with some olive oil. I stirred them frequently while they cooked. Next, I added some garlic into the pot. I then added some ground beef. I mixed it together and let it cook until it was browned. I then added a big carton of beef stock, some water, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I then chopped my bell peppers into small pieces and added them to the pot. I let the soup slowly boil until the peppers were soft. At the end, I threw in a handful of Italian bread crumbs and some Parmesan cheese for some flavor. I was so excited to serve up a bowl and eat it.
5	getting the newspaper	I'm standing in my kitchen looking out the window at the front lawn when I notice the mail truck pass by and toss the daily paper out onto my driveway. I make sure I'm dressed to go outside and proceed to exit out my front door to retrieve the paper. Making sure no cars are close by on the road, where the paper was close by, I walked down my driveway and bent over to pick it up. The paper was enclosed in a plastic sleeve, so I removed the sleeve and threw it away in the garbage on my way back inside. The paper had been rolled up, so I proceeded to unroll it and smooth out any wrinkles or creases. I unfolded the paper to its regular size, and began to look at the main title on the front page. I open the paper up and look at the different sections where stories are written.
6	cooking fish	Fish is my all time favorite dish from anywhere. I prefer fresh fish. We have big international market, and I bought some pomfret fish, which was $4 per pound. I bought 3 lbs. I decided to make fry fish. I told the butcher to make thin slices. I washed them nicely, dried them on paper. Then, I marinated fish  with salt lemon garlic and black pepper. Then, I seasoned flour with all time spice. Now, one by one I coated fish in seasoned flour and set aside. I put them in refrigerator for half an hour. After hour, I put the big flat pan on stove over 350 degrees. When It became hot enough, I slowly put pieces of fish one by one, next to each other. Did not overcrowd them. I let it cook each side for at least 3 to 4 minutes, and then turned them over, and cooked another 3 minutes on medium temperature. It was very crispy and delicious.
7	making a camping trip	My son and I decided that we wanted to go camping somewhere not too far from where we live. I looked online and found a campsite that had lots of activities. There was a lake and some biking trails so we would bring our swimsuits and our bicycles. The website said that the campground was first come first serve so we decided to get there early, around 3pm. We loaded the car with the tent and sleeping bags and some food to grill over the fire. When we got to the campground they assigned us a spot near the lake. We went to the campsite and unloaded our tent and set it up. We purchased some firewood at the store so we could have an evening fire. With things all ready for sleeping we put on our swimsuits and headed down to the lake. After our swim we went back to the campsite and started our fire. We made a nice dinner and read some stories before we went to bed. In the morning we rode our bikes on the bike trails and when we got back we pulled down the tent and packed up the car. It was a lovely camping experience.
8	sewing a button	One of the buttons came off on my shirt, so I have to sew it back on. Sewing a button can be tricky, since you need a very steady hand. I get some thread and a sewing needle and get to work. I carefully put the button on my shirt, and start sewing. I tie a knot on the end of my thread, and put the needle through the underside of my shirt to where the button is. I guide the needle from under the shirt through one of the holes in the button, and then back through another hole. I do this many times, alternating between the four holes to make sure the button's on tight. There are a lot of ways you can sew a button, but I like to do it so the stitch looks like an X. Once I've done it enough times, I can tie off my thread and my button's as good as new!
9	changing a baby diaper	I was babysitting my nephew one night while my sister and brother in law went out on a date.  I had fed him, burped him and played with him.  We were in the middle of a peek a boo game when I smelled something off.  I knew he needed his diaper changed.  I went to the hallway and grabbed his diaper bag.  Then, I took out his green changing mat.  I searched through the bag and grabbed a clean diaper, the wipes and some baby powder.  Then I grabbed my nephew and took off his pants and unsnapped his onesie.  He was awfully wriggly, so I knew I'd have to do this quickly!  I took off his dirty diaper. Then, I took out a wipe from the container and wiped his backside.  When I was sure he was clean enough, I put the clean diaper under him and sprinkled baby powder over him.  Then I secured the diaper and put his clothes back on him.
10	making toasted bread	I decided that I wanted to eat toasted bread with my breakfast, so I opened the loaf of bread and removed two slices from the package. I took those two slices of bread and put them into the toaster, putting each slice of bread into its own open slots. Once the bread was situated in the toaster, I use my finger to push down the toaster lever. When I did that, the bread disappeared into the toaster, and as I looked inside I saw that the heating coils inside were warm and illuminated. I watched as that heat toasted the bread and the bread became darker in color. In an instant, the toaster bell rain, the toasted bread popped up, and the toaster turned off the heat and elimination of the coils. The bread have been toasted, and I removed the slices of toast from the toaster, placing them on my plate so that I can prepare them with butter and jelly for my breakfast.
11	fueling a car	Yesterday I had to put gas into my car, so I drove to nearest gas station. When I pulled into the gas station I made sure I pulled my car up to the gas pump with the with the correct fueling side of the vehicle facing the gasoline pump. I got out of my car and took note of the gasoline pump number before walking into the gas station and telling the store clerk I need $45 worth of gas on pump number 3 and then handed her $45 cash. I walked back out to the gas pump and made sure my vehicle was completely off before removing the gasoline cap on my car. I lifted the gasoline nozzle from the gas pump and stuck it into the gas hole on my car. I was now ready to pump gas. I squeezed the gasoline nozzle on the pump handle and held the nozzle firmly as I waited for all the gasoline to be pumped into my car. Once the gasoline pump signaled that I was finished pumping, I slowly took the gas nozzle out of my car and put it back on the nozzle holder located on the gas pump. I screwed the gasoline cap back onto the gas hole on my car before getting back into my car and driving away.
12	playing a movie	I am bored and want to do something. I remember I just bought that new DVD movie last week and still haven't watched it. I decide to watch a movie. I look at my shelf of movies and find the one I want to watch. I open the DVD case and remove the DVD. I walk toward my TV and find my DVD player. I turn my DVD player on and hit the "open" button. The DVD player pops open. I place the DVD into the open slot. I then push the slot closed. I turn on my TV and switch from cable to HDMI. The movie is playing through the opening trailers. I wait 20 minutes until they play through and it brings me to the opening screen. I grab my remote and press the "OK" button while on the "play" option. The movie begins to play. I enjoy it for two and half hours.
13	going on a date	Its Friday night and I have a date set up with my husband to go to a new restaurant they opened in a nearby town. We have been looking forward to go out all week because my husband has been very busy with work all week and hasn't really had any time to relax. I have been swamped at work also; but I took time out of work early that Friday to get ready. I want to pull out all the stops and look as if  we were going out when we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I arrive home early and pull out the new dress I bought ages ago just for an occasion as tonight. I am in the process of getting ready, when my husband arrives home and is excited as well. He tells me after dinner that he has a surprise for me. So I get more excited and hurry to finish getting ready. He is ready in twenty minutes and is waiting while I take another twenty to get ready. When I walk downstairs he looks at me as if we were still going out and that puts a smile on my face immediately. Tonight is going to be a good night, I thought to myself as he grabs my hand. We make our reservations to the Italiano restaurant  on time and have a wonderful dinner and enjoy our time together. He can't take his eyes off of me and I can't either. Then after dinner, he takes me to his surprise, which is dancing at a small jazz club he recently discovered. We dance the night away, enjoying every moment. Knowing that this date will never end since we already live together and are happily married.
14	washing clothes	Today was laundry day. I gathered up all of my clothes into my basket and headed downstairs with them to the laundry room. Once in the laundry room, I pulled out the clothes one by one and started separated them into different piles. There was one pile for colors, and another for whites. The colors would go into the washer first. I added the clothes and measured out the correct amount of detergent needed for the size of the load, and poured it into the reservoir. I turned the dial to be on Colors and pressed start. When the washer was done after 30 minutes, I moved the washed clothes to the dryer. I added a dryer sheet, checked that the lint trap was empty, and started the dryer on the setting for Automatic dry, low heat. I then placed the whites into the washer, added detergent, and started the washer on the setting for whites. When the dryer was finished, I took out the clothes and brought them upstairs to be folded and put away. I moved the whites into the dryer and set them to dry. When they finished, I also brought them upstairs to fold and put away.
15	getting a haircut	I was looking in the mirror yesterday and noticed that my hair was too long , so I decided to get a haircut . I called my regular salon to see if they were busy . Luckily , they were not and I was told to come right in . I drove to the salon and checked in with the receptionist at the front desk . I was told to take a seat and that someone would be with me shortly . I was only seated for a few minutes when the hairdresser said that she was ready for me . She led me over to a chair and I sat down . We discussed what I wanted to do with my hair , a trim , and then she took me to the shampoo area . My hair was washed and conditioned and then I was led back to the hairdresser 's chair . She combed my hair out and then cut off the split ends a few small sections at a time . I saw little wisps of my hair fall onto the floor . When the hairdresser was finished cutting , she took out a blow dryer and dried my hair . I looked in the mirror and I was very pleased with my haircut . I walked back over to the receptionist and paid for the cut . I added about twenty percent as a tip to reward the hairdresser for doing a great job . I left the hair salon and drove home . 
16	attending a wedding ceremony	I remember the day that my brother got married like it was yesterday. The ceremony was perfect. He and his bride found a quaint little winery nestled in Virginia, right smack dab in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley. I arrived that morning and checked into my hotel with my date. I feel like I was more nervous then my brother! I quickly showered and pulled on my suit, before heading down to the ceremony. I pulled aside my brother and gave him a hug. I told him how proud of him I was, and how happy I was for his bride to become a part of our family. He thanked me and we made our way down. I took my place up front, and as the seats began to fill, I could not have been happier. I saw the smiles on everyone's face. I barely remember anything the pastor said during the ceremony. I just stood their, grin from ear to ear. It was the first and last time I have ever cried tears of joy.
17	planting a tree	Every year we celebrate Arbor Day . Last year we we decided to celebrate the holiday by planing a tree . We went to the local plant nursery . We talked to the employees to find out which trees grow well in our area and in the type of soil we have . We chose a small maple seedling . When we got home , we chose an area of our yard with lots of sun . We dug a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling . We put the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully , then covered the roots with dirt . We patted the dirt down really good to make sure the little tree seedling would be stable in the ground when it was windy . Then we watered the tree . We 've been watching and watering our tree for a year and slowly but surely our little tree is growing . 
18	making fresh orange juice	Last weekend I was cooking a big breakfast and wanted to make fresh squeezed orange juice. I had a bag of oranges in the fridge so I pulled them out and cut them in half then I realized I couldn't find my juicer. I had my heart set on fresh juice and I decided to blend them. I cut the skins off of the oranges and put the skins down my sink to run them through the garbage disposal. I added all of the fruit to my blender pitcher and slowly started pulsing to see if they would catch the blade. I then pushed the blend button and held the lid. I blended until it looked like everything was liquefied and poured it into cups. The blended orange juice was even better than regular juiced orange juice, it was frothy and whipped and reminded me a little bit of an orange julius.
19	putting up a painting	I bought a really beautiful painting for my new flat. I needed to put the painting up on the wall to display it. I  found the perfect spot on the wall that I wanted to put it on. I went to my tool bag and got a hammer, a nail, a piece of chalk, and a leveler. I marked the spot I wanted to put the nail in with the piece of chalk I had. I carefully put the nail on the spot, then took my hammer and hit it a few times. When I checked to make sure it was going in straight, I kept hammering it in. I hammered it in until it was half way in the wall and half way not. I put the hammer down. I picked up the painting and hung the frame on the wall. I then took the level and made sure it was even. When I was sure I had it hung even, I put my tools away.
20	planting a tree	I love cherries . I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . I drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live . They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . I went to the cashier and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck . When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . In the middle of the hole I made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone . I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . I replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole . When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . After a few hours , I watered it again . When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard ! 
21	making scrambled eggs	I am on ketogenic diet, so eggs are like life saver. I always buy good quality eggs. Other day I bought some free roaming eggs from market. I want to make scrambled eggs. So first in a bowl I cracked 4 eggs one by one. Then with fork I whipped them for a while when they mixed very well, but did not overdo. I turned on my stove, put the nonstick pan on and  turned stove on medium heat. Meanwhile I got some cheese and salsa out for extra flavor. When the pan was hot enough, I added 2 tablespoon of unsalted  butter( I love butter), and then I did not wait it to be hot, but immediately poured my eggs into pan. The pan was already hot, so I started to bubble and cook. In a minute, I started to stir my eggs, added some cheese and salsa, salt and some pepper. I stirred the eggs till they became fluffy and cooked. When all moisture disappeared, I moved pan from stove, transferred it to plate.
22	packing a suitcase	I was so excited for my trip to the beach.  I would be there for five days so I wanted to make sure I packed everything I needed.  I decided to take my large suitcase and a smaller travel bag.  I laid out everything I wanted to take before I started putting the items in my bag.  First I put in a pair of pants.  Beside my pants, I put in three pairs of shorts.  I added two casual dresses on top of the pants.  Then I put in three folded t-shirts, two tank tops and a linen blouse.  On top of that layer I added two bathing suits and a cover up.  I put my underclothes on the top layer along with a pair of pajamas.  In the front section of my suitcase I put in two pairs of sandals, a pair of flip flops and a pair of tennis shoes.  That was all that fit into the larger suitcase.  I put my toiletries into the smaller bag - shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, toothbrush, makeup and deodorant.  I realized I had forgotten beach towels so I got a large tote bag that I could also carry to the beach and put two towels in there along with a bottle of sunscreen.  Now I was all ready for my beach trip!
23	washing one¡¯s hair	When I woke up in the morning I noticed that my hair was not looking very clean. It was time to have a shower and wash my hair. I turned on the water in the shower and waited for it to heat up. Then I stepped in and started to wet my hair. When my hair was completely wet I reached for the shampoo bottle and squeezed a small amount into my hand. Then I rubbed this shampoo into every part of my hair. I scrubbed and scrubbed allowing the bubbles to get really big. Then it was time to make my hair really clean. I let the water run all the way over my hair and I kept pushing it through until I could feel that my hair was squeaky clean. I turned the water off. My hair was now clean. I found a towel and wrapped it around my head so that my hair could dry. When I had gotten dressed I used the hairdryer to completely dry my hair. Now when I looked in the mirror my hair was shiny and sparkling. It was perfectly clean.
24	cleaning up toys	"Oh my goodness, look at that!" Mother said as she peeked into my room. I looked around for a monster, but all I saw was lots of mess! "If you clean your room today we can go to the park," she said. When Mother left I started to pick up. Sometimes when your sister leaves dolls around you have to clean them up too. I put the dolls on the bed, and the bears in the net above the shelf. Then I picked up blocks. Blocks take a long time! I put all of them into my toy box. Then I remembered that I had left a puzzle underneath all of that. I put all of the pieces back into the wooden puzzle and stacked it on top of the others on the shelf. All clean! Now I can go to the park. "All teen!" my sister said, grinning.
25	answering the phone	Sammy's phone starting ringing and she answered the call. It was a man named Geoff. And he said that he was offering a service for free if Sammy would just activate her service with her credit card number. Sammy said no thank you, goodbye have a good day. her phone started ringing again and it was Geoff again asking Sammy if shoe would just take two minutes of her time out of her day and speak to him. She said, "Okay, is there anything that you have to offer?" Geoff replied with a simple yes. He continued to speak and Sammy got bored and hung up the phone. she then blocked Geoff's phone number. But little did she know Geoff was at her door right then and he broke  in and said, Give it a try ill give you a thirty day free trial! Sammy yelled the loudest she could and said NO!!
26	feeding the fish	At home, I have a 20-gallon fish tank filled with colorful tropical fish. I keep it in the living room on a special table where everyone can admire the fish. It makes me feel peaceful to sit and watch the fish as they drift and swim around. I have taken great care in selecting the fish that go into the tank, to make sure they will all get along. There is an expert at the fish store who gives me instructions on how to make sure the fish are happy and healthy in their environment. Part of the daily regimen is feeding the fish the best food I can get for them. I love to lift the lid of the tank and sprinkle their special food onto the surface of the water. The fish rise to the surface and begin to eat the food. They know it's dinner time, based on my motions and the lifting of the lid. I know just how much food to give them in order to keep the fish happy and satisfied.
27	changing bed sheets	Every Friday I make a point to clean my room.  Part of cleaning my room involves stripping my bed and changing my sheets.  First I take off all of the bedding from my bed.  Then, I take the sheets and take them to the laundry room.  I put them in the washing machine to get them nice and clean.  After that, I put them on the clothes line to dry them outside.  While the sheets are being cleaned, I take out a clean set and take them to my bedroom.  First, I put the fitted sheet on.  Then, I put on the top sheet.  I make sure to smooth out the sheets before I add the other blankets and finish making the bed.  Once the bed is made, I wait for the sheets to dry on the line and then I go bring them inside.  I fold them up and put them in the linen closet to use for next time.
28	attending a wedding ceremony	When I last attended a wedding ceremony, I felt excited, but somewhat annoyed that it was hot and I had to wear a suit and jacket. Upon dressing for the morning, I took my time to do my hair and make sure that my suit and tie looked stylish. I then left and went to the wedding. I felt compelled to talk to everyone, including people that I really didn't know. I enjoyed the ceremony with my significant other and gave my gift to the bride and groom. I had a great conversation with everyone and talked about how extravagant the ceremony was. I had a great time and felt that I had great conversation with everyone.  I was extremely excited to see family that I had not seen in forever and was excited that people came from all over to see the bridge and groom. Overall, it was a great experience.
29	making a bed	Yesterday morning, I woke up a rolled out of bed. After having a long rocky sleep, I knocked all of the covers off of the bed. As a result, I had to make the bed in the morning. In order to do so, I looked for the tag and attempted to put the blanket on the bed the right way. This was an easy job and I felt that I was able to do it quickly. Upon making the bed, I placed all of the pillows onto the bed and placed two on each side of the bed. I felt that I made the bed well and my bed looked much more orderly than it looked prior to making it. I also made sure to clear everything off of the bed before putting the covers on because I didn't want them to cover the items. This was an easy and quick process.
30	feeding a cat	My cat Max lets me know when he's hungry. He meows pitifully, like his heart is broken. Then he walks back and forth in front of me as I prepare his food, snapping his tail. That's so I don't forget him, I guess. I always wash his bowl first. Then I dry it, and pour in a scoop of kibble. I put a chunk of canned cat food on top of that, less than a quarter of a flat can. Next, I put the bowl on the floor and stand back. He runs to the bowl and starts eating as fast as he can. He eats all the soft food on the top as fast as lightning. Then he takes his time with the kibble, eating more and more slowly until its gone. When he finally finishes  he slinks away. Then I wipe up the floor, because Max is not a tidy eater.
31	checking in at an airport	I had a friend drop me off at the terminal so I did not have to park. I went inside to the counter of the airline I was flying with. I handed the agent my passport and asked if I was checking bags, I told them I was checking one bag so they had me run my debit card to pay the baggage fee. The agent printed my boarding pass and handed it to me along with my passport and a sticker with a number to match the sticker they attached to my suitcase. He told me that the flight was boarding at 6:15 so I had more than enough time. I thanked the agent and left my suitcase which they put on a sticker on and put on the conveyor belt behind the counter. I thanked the agent and double checked that I had my boarding pass and passport and proceeded to security.
32	paying bills	I open up my bills and look at when each one is due for payment.  The bills that are due within the next two weeks are ones I will pay.  I look at each bill and confirm it is the correct amount.  If it is a credit card bill I look at each charge and make sure it is correct.  Then I take out my check book and write a check for each bill.  The front of the check book lets me record my payment with check number, date, whom I am paying, and how much.  On each check I fill in the date and the name of the person I'm paying, then I write out the dollar amount in words and also write it in numbers.  I sign the check and can also write in the account number if needed.  I put each bill and check in a return envelope.  I make sure I have the correct check with each bill.  I seal the envelope and put my return name and address on the front left corner.  I also put a stamp on the front right corner.  Then I post them in the mail.
33	planting a tree	My friend , Tom , had moved into a new house , and decided to plant a small tree to help make his yard look better . He had been advised by a tree expert , that the best time to plant it was in April or May . So about several weeks after Tom had moved into his new home , he went ahead to plant the tree in mid April . He first got and checked some maps to make sure he did n't mistakenly end up digging into any telephone or gas lines . Once he found a suitable spot to plant his new tree , Tom took a shovel and began preparing the hole to place it in . Next , he prepared the tree for planting by turning carefully upside down to remove it from the pot it came in . He then gently , placed the tree into the hole . Tom also filled the hole with some compost and manure to help the tree grow better . Once this was done , he filled up the hole completely and watered the tree . Finally , he placed mulch on top and then stopped to admire the beautiful new tree in his yard . 
34	driving a car	Just recently, I began to study how to drive a car. After enough time was spent doing this, i asked my dad if he could take me out to drive out on an open road for practice, and he said yes. Once we took the car out to an open, empty road, I tried my best to show him what I'd learned. I showed him that I knew how to shift gears, use the parking brake, and showed that I was able to make both smooth and sharp turns, along with keeping an eye on things like the speed limit, gas tank reserves, and so on. He seemed to be very impressed with how I did, so he allowed me to get my learner's permit so that I could legally learn how to drive on the street with other people, as long as he or my mom was in the car with me. This is just one step closer to getting my license.
35	making a bonfire	It was a beautiful summer night, and my sister and I decided to make a bonfire. We went outside to see if we had enough firewood and discovered that we didn't have enough wood for our fire. I decided to go out into the forest to pick up some more wood while my sister used the wood we had to get a fire started. I walked around for ten minutes picking up any stray logs, branches or twigs that I could find. Once I had gathered a decent amount of firewood, I went back to find my sister and see how the fire was coming. She had gotten a pretty good start but the fire definitely needed some more wood. I took the branches I had gathered them and made them into a teepee formation on top of the fire my sister had started. The branches quickly lit and our fire was huge in no time! We enjoyed our night out by the fire and cooked some hot dogs and made s'mores at the end of the night.
36	making tea	I need some hot tea to start my day. I find the tea in the cabinet above the hot water kettle and pull out one tea bag. I find my favorite tea mug in the other cabinet and bring it over to the kettle. I remove the teabag from the paper wrapper. While holding the tea bag, I loop the string around the handle and drop the bag in the mug. This keeps the bag from sliding completely into the mug when I Pour the water. I grab the kettle, open the lid and fill it to the limit with filtered water from the tap. I then put the kettle back on its base and turn on. It only takes a little over a minute to boil and the water is the perfect temperature for tea. I begin to slowly pour the water into my mug. The tea takes a few minutes to steep and then it's ready.
37	paying bills	Yesterday, I paid my bills for the month of May. I have a number of bills that I need to keep track of, including heat, water, and gas. I have to pay three different companies to clear those bills. In order to remind myself of the bill payment deadlines, I have a sticky note on my refrigerator door with all of the upcoming month's deadlines. A few days ago, I noticed that the deadlines for May were coming up, so yesterday I decided to just tackle all of my payments. I got out my checkbook and a ballpoint pen. I wrote one check to the heat company for $120, one check to the water company for $100, and one check to the gas company for $130. I then stuffed each check into a separate envelope, wrote the addresses of the companies onto their respective envelopes, and dropped off the envelopes into the mail pickup box.
38	painting a wall	I had just moved into a new home.  The house had been empty for quite a few years.  As a result, there was a lot of remodeling to do.  One of the first things I decided to do was paint the living room walls.  The walls were currently painted an ugly yellow and the paint was peeling.  I went to the paint store and looked over the paint colors.  I settled on a calming blue.  I figured out how much paint I would need by calculating the area of the room, then I bought enough gallons to cover the job.  I left the store and loaded the paint and supplies I bought into my car.  After getting home, I spread a plastic drop cloth over the floor and got the paint ready.  I took a brush and dipped it in the paint and spread it over the wall.  This was going to look much better!
39	baking a cake	I am more of a cook rather than a baker of pastries and sweets . But with the internet and YouTube anything can be found . I searched YouTube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down . Not too bad for a non baker but I 'll stick to cooking .
40	making omelette	My stomach woke me up this morning. It was rumbling so loud, at first I thought it was an earthquake! I jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen. I knew that I was going to need something that would fill my empty stomach up, so I decided to make an omelette. I opened the fridge and grabbed a carton of eggs and some mixed vegetables I chopped up last night. Then I opened the cabinet to get a bowl to mix my eggs in. I scrambled the eggs up with a fork, and then got a pan to put on the stove to cook the eggs in. After I turned on the stove, I put some a little bit of oil in the pan so the eggs wouldn't stick. I hate when that happens, it always makes cleaning up after really hard! Then I poured the eggs from the bowl into the pan and waited for the eggs to start to firm up. I poked at them with a spatula, pushing parts from the edge of the pan that were kinda firm slowly towards the middle of the pan. The uncooked runny eggs slide over to where the firm eggs were and cook up really quick! When there was no more runny eggs left, I turned off the stove and spread my mixed veggies on one side of the omelette. Then I used my spatula to fold the omelette in half so that the mixed veggies were in between the sides of the omelette, kind of like a sandwich. I put my omelette on a plate and took it over to my table to sit down and eat. My stomach roared like a lion when I looked down at the omelette. I think it took me less than a minute to eat the whole thing!
41	driving a car	Last summer a friend of mine was moving across the country.  He had a lot of things and did not know how he would get his car to his new home.  I offered to drive it there for him if he would fly me back.  My friend agreed.  I started driving early in the morning.  I had to go to a gas station to fill up and to wipe off the windows.  I merged onto a freeway and saw that there was hardly any traffic.  I set the cruise control and turned the music up.  I wasn't paying too much attention to the speed that I was going, and I passed a cop on the side of the road.  The cop got behind me and turned on his lights.  I pulled over.  He came to my car to explain that I had been speeding.  I apologized, and the cop decided to let me go with a warning.
42	making a dinner reservation	My parents are visiting me next weekend, and I want to surprise them with a dinner reservation at a nice restaurant. I know we all like Japanese food, so I check Yelp for nearby Japanese restaurants with high ratings and reasonable prices. Once I find one that looks good, I check the menu to make sure there are options we would all like. Yum, the menu looks great. There are vegetarian options available for me, chicken options for my dad, and fish for my mother. I call the restaurant, requesting a reservation for Saturday at 6pm for three for dinner. The restaurant luckily enough does have a table available for the time I requested. The reservation will be under my last name. My parents and I are all set for dinner Saturday: I'm looking forward to eating Japanese food and talking to them! I think my parents will like their surprise.
43	playing tennis	I really enjoy all sports and I find that playing tennis is an excellent way to stay in shape.  I just moved to a new neighborhood and there are some public tennis courts in the park across from my apartment.  I decided to take some tennis lessons during the winter to make sure that I would be ready to play when spring came.  I really enjoyed the lessons and I actually became a pretty good player.  I decided to join a recreational tennis league in my neighborhood.  I joined a women's singles league and I have had a really good time playing tennis once or twice a week.  It's very convenient to meet right at the neighborhood courts and play tennis for an hour in the evenings.  I even decide dot treat myself to a brand new tennis racket.  Tennis is a sport that I hope to continue playing as I get older.
44	playing tennis	First we travel to the tennis court. Next we change into our sports clothes, and put on our tennis shoes. Then we grab our equipment and some balls from the supply. We begin to play the match. Tennis involves hitting a ball with something called a "tennis racket". This racket allows you to swing and hit a ball over a net. The goal is to avoid hitting the net, and hit the ball so that it is difficult for your opponent to hit the ball back to you. However, if your opponent hits the ball, he must also make sure the ball doesn't touch the net. Both of you may hit the ball off the ground, reflecting it into the air yet you must avoid the net. If your opponent hits the next or makes the ball go out of bounds, then you score a point. The objective is to make your opponent hit the net as many times as you can.
45	sending food back (in a restaurant)	Yesterday Steve and I went out to dinner at a newly opened Mexican restaurant. We'd both heard they had good Al Pastor, so he ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I ordered an Al Pastor quesadilla. After waiting quite long, nearly 30 minutes, we finally received our food. It's true that the Al Pastor was tasty but it was also spicy! Insanely spicy! It as so spicy that neither Steve or I could actually eat it. After a few bites we were gulping down water and calling the waiter to come back over. I apologized and asked if we could switch the dish for something with a similar price. Steve added that the dish was so hot, it should come with a warning. Our server apologized and agreed to bring us the same dishes, but with shredded steak instead of the Al Pastor. The new dishes came out more quickly than the first two and were much more edible.
46	laying flooring in a room	Steve and Jeff moved into a new house on Main street. the moving truck brought in the package of wood flooring. Steve and Jeff weren't sure how to lay it down so they made sure that they had enough money left in the budget to get a company to lay down the flooring in their kitchen for them. and they did so they scheduled an appointment for Wednesday.  Wednesday came upon them quickly and there was a knock at Steve and Jeff's door Steve answered the door. It was a man from the company her to lay down the flooring in the kitchen. Steve let him in and the man started to work he began by cutting open the package of wood flooring with a knife. he then layer it all out and started to glue it to the floor and then he put on a special kind of gloss to finish it up. Steve and Jeff thanked the worker man, and gave him the payment he required and then he left. Steve and Jeff sat and enjoyed their new wooden floor that day they finished moving into their new house on Main street.
47	boiling milk	Yesterday I boiled milk for my mom. Whenever she goes to work she asks me to do tasks for her so that when she comes home she doesn't have to do it. Yesterday she wanted me to walk across the street to the store and buy some milk. I did, and after that I walked back home and closed the door. My mom left me instructions how to boil the milk for her. I got a big pan and put it on the oven. I turned on the oven and made the pan hot by turning the dial to high. Once the pot was hot enough I poured the milk inside, I poured around half of it. After a while the milk started to get hot, which I could see because it would move and I saw steam. When bubbles started appearing in the milk, I knew it was boiled and done.
48	cleaning the shower	This morning I decided to clean our bathroom shower in our house.  I knew it should only take about fifteen minutes so I got started right away.  I gathered together a cleaning sponge, a shower cleaning spray, a rinse cup, and a towel to dry my hands.  First, I removed everything I could from the shower such as shampoo bottles, soap, and razors.  Next I sprayed the shower with a shower cleaner.  I allowed this to stay on the walls about five minutes.  Then I took a wet sponge and began rubbing the tub and shower walls with a circular motion.  Soon it all looked sparkly so I took my rinse cup and filled it with water.  I used this to wash off all the soap from the walls.  I checked to make sure I didn't miss any spots.  I placed the shampoo, soap, and razors back into their spots.  I dried my hands, and I was done.
49	changing a light bulb	I woke up this morning and when I turned on the bathroom light switch I noticed that one of the bulbs popped and burned out. I checked the closet where I normally keep light bulbs and could not find any. I removed the bulb to see what size I needed and made myself a note on a post it. On my way to work I stopped at the grocery store and bought a pack of replacement bulbs. When I got home from work I opened the new package of bulbs and carefully screwed the new bulb in. It immediately lit up when the contacts connected. Figuring that the other three bulbs were the same age and would probably blow out soon I decided to change the rest of them. I carefully removed and replaced each bulb. I put the bad bulbs into the package and put them in the trash.
50	taking a shower	I love getting a shower because it is quick and easy.  You may be tired, and you can still rinse off quickly, and  be clean before you go to bed.  The first thing I do is get my pajamas ready, and my towel and wash cloth. I then bring those into the bathroom, and undress. I start the shower, and make sure that the water is not too hot or cold.  When I like the temperature of the water, I get in and use the soap to lather up with the wash cloth.  I then wash my hair and rinse it.  I put in some conditioner for my hair and let it sit for a few minutes, as I finish scrubbing my body down.  Then I rinse the conditioner and my body for the last time, an turn the water off.  When I get out, I dry my body with my towel, put on my pajamas, and go to bed.
51	making a flight reservation	The last time that I made a flight reservation, I planned everything well in advance. I spoke with my dad and sister and my dad told me that in order to not get ripped off, you have to constantly check the prices of airfare and keep checking often. He said that prices tend to be cheaper on certain days of the week and you should clear your search history to avoid the airlines keeping the prices high. I made the reservation after reviewing the prices and received a good deal. This took a lot of work and required me looking around at different airlines for the perfect fight. While this process was somewhat long and difficult, I felt great that I was able to get a good deal and save a lot of money. Unfortunately, I also had to pick seats and pay more and also pay more for bags.
52	preparing dinner	I went to the store and gathered purchased everything needed to make dinner for tonight. I got home then went straight to the kitchen to start cooking. I first started boiling the water so I could cook the pasta. At the same time my water was boiling, I browned the hamburger meat. I add the noodles to the boiling water and wait for them to cook. After the hamburger was cooked all the way through I added some extra spices. I added in a half of a can of pizza sauce, a half of a can of spaghetti sauce and a handful of pepperonis to my hamburger meat and heat that all up. Now that both components of my dinner are completed I drain the noodles and add the meat sauce to the pan of cooked noodles. I heat all of it up to make sure it is nice and hot then add a little bit of Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. I dish out a scoop into a bowl and enjoy.
53	making tea	I wanted to make some tea. First, I checked the shelves with colorful boxes of tea bags to decide what kind of tea I wanted. There were mostly orange boxes containing orange pekoe tea. Boxes bordered with green contained green tea. The boxes with an earth toned nature picture on them contained herbal tea. I took an herbal tea box off the shelf, opened the box and took out a tea bag. Then I went to the cupboard and took out a yellow microwavable mug. I filled the mug with water and put the tea bag in it. I put the mug in the microwave oven on high for two minutes. I then put the mug on a saucer and let it sit for ten or fifteen minutes until the tea got darker. It took awhile for the tea to finish brewing, as it is not necessary to heat it for the whole time, since it it is still very hot when it comes out of the microwave. Then I drank the herbal tea.
54	going on a date	My parents said it was okay to start dating as long as it was a double date with my older sister who would, in essence chaperon me.  I was embarrassed by this  set up, but it was better than not dating at all.   My sister said we would go see a movie at the local cinema on Saturday at 6PM.  Our parents wanted me home by 11 PM.  On Saturday I was so excited and started getting ready very early.  My sister told me to calm down that i was getting ready way too soon.  So I took off my clothes and put on something different.  Finally the time came to get ready and I was excited again.  We left the house at 4:30 and picked up my friend.  He was so handsome! By 5:00 we were at the ice cream shop where we met up with her boyfriend and had ice cream.  Then we went to the movies. My sisters boyfriend purchased popcorn and sodas for all of us.  We munched, drank and watched the movie.  Once it was over we went to the mall and ate at the food court and went and played video games at the arcade. Around 10 PM we were ready to leave.  My sister kissed her boyfriend goodbye and me and my friend piled back into my sisters car.  She dropped him off at his house about 10:15 and he gave me a peck on the cheek.  My sister raised her eyebrow but didn't say anything.  Around 10:30 we showed up to our house where my mom wanted to know everything that went on.  I was in 7th heaven and told her the entirety of the story.  Except maybe the kiss.
55	planting a tree	I found a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought it home to plant in my garden . I had already picked the spot it was to go , a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun . After gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves , I set to work on digging the hole . I had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably . I dampened the soil in the hole with a little water . Once the hole was ready , I laid the tree on its side and gently removed the pot from it . I placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots . I tamped the soil down , so as to prevent any air pockets , and watered it once more . I think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard ! 
56	cooking fish	One day, I went out to sea. It was a stormy day, and it was cold. It was blowing, the wind, too. I rocked and rocked on the boat until I vomited everywhere. Then we caught a big salmon. This fish was huge, I mean, really big. It was so big, the boat tipped over when we brought it on board. We had to swim around the boat and tip it back over. One of the crew didn't make it back! But the salmon we caught did. We took this beautiful salmon back to the shore and cooked it. Then we all partook in eating the salmon fish. It was a delight, with butter and garlic, and salt too. It was flaky and moist and very tasty. It was enjoyed by all of the party who then began to digest the salmon. The salmon even digested very well and all were pleased.
57	making soup	I found the large soup pot, made sure it was clean, and set it on the stove top.  I chose the ingredients I wanted to use in the soup and set them on the table.  Then I started the spice base for the soup by cutting up an onion in thin slices, and crushing a few cloves of garlic.  I put about a tablespoon of butter in the pan and turned on the heat to melt it, then added the onions and garlic to saute.  While they cooked, I cut up the vegetables.  I cut carrots into thick slices, and potatoes into one inch cubes, leaving the skin on for extra vitamins. Fresh green beans were trimmed and cut into one inch lengths. Then I put the vegetables in the soup pan and stirred them before adding six cups or so of water and heating it to a boil. Turning it down to simmer, I let it cook until the vegetables were soft enough to eat.
58	taking a shower	The last time I took a shower, I followed the same routine that I always do. I gathered my clothes and towel and took it all to the bathroom. I then went into the bathroom and undressed, before turning on the shower water. Upon turning on the water, I went in and started to lather soap down my body. I always make sure to get every part of my body clean and then I take the shampoo and wash my hair. I usually stand there after and enjoy a few minutes of just letting the water hit me. After washing my hair, I usually get out and get a towel and start to dry myself. The whole process usually takes about fifteen minutes, but it is an enjoyable experience. Sometimes I listen to music when I am in the shower, but I usually just enjoy my warm shower without music.
59	going to a funeral	A friend died and I am going to go to his funeral. The day before the funeral I pick out the clothes that I will wear to the funeral. I will make sure the clothes are clean. If not I take the clothes to the dry cleaners to have the cleaned. Then pick them up later that day. On the day of the funeral I put the clothes that I picked out. I drive to the funeral home and try to get there early in case there are a lot of people. If I get there early then I can get a good seat. During the funeral I listen to people talk. Usually at a funeral someone talks about the good things the dead person did. After this part of the funeral I go to the cemetery where the dead person will be buried. Sometimes after that many people get together and eat some food and visit.
60	making soup	It was a chilly winter night and my boyfriend and I decided that we wanted to make soup. I thought that making a loaded baked potato soup would be good for a cold night. I went to the refrigerator to look for the ingredients we would need. I pulled out some potatoes I had already boiled, carrots, heavy cream, milk, sour cream, chives, bacon bits, butter, and flour. I began by making a roux in the pan by mixing the butter and the flour together. Once my roux was done, I added the heavy cream and milk to the pan. I let the heavy cream and milk mixture come to a simmer and then I added sour cream and cheddar cheese. After that, I added my boiled potatoes and the chopped up vegetables. Once the soup was thickened, I topped it with bacon bits and chives. I poured a bowl of soup for both me and my boyfriend and topped them with sour cream. We ate our soup and enjoyed what we made.
61	putting up a painting	I just bought a new house so I need to decorate it with art. I have lots of paintings but I just bought a new one that I know will great above the fireplace.  I have a ladder that is just the right height so I climb it with my measuring tape in hand. I measure to the center of the wall and mark the spot with a pencil. Then I get my girlfriends screw gun and put a screw in the wall. Now it's time to get the painting and hang it on the screw. I take a step back and see if I like it. It's also important to see if my girlfriend likes it. When she gets home from work we both stare at the painting and make sure it's even on the wall and that we like where it is placed. We are both satisfied with the painting.
62	getting the newspaper	Laying on my side, in bed staring out the window...it must only be 6 a.m. I hear a thud, the same thud I hear every day around this time, with the exception of Sundays. The paper is here. I slowly swing my legs around out of the bed and stand up, reaching to the adjacent chair I grab my robe and put it on. It is soft and red like a micro plush blanket. I shuffle stiffly down the stairs and to the door, turn both locks...this sound prompts my great dane to come running down the stairs thinking there is an intruder... Like we don't go through the same routine nearly every day. I open the door a crack to lean out and grab the paper. Shutting the door I turn around and head towards the kitchen where my great dane patiently waits by his food dish.
63	taking a taxi	So I stand there on the side of the street, made an eye contact with the cab driver, and raised my hand and waved at him. He gave me a quick flash of his headlights to signal that he saw me, He made his way to the side of the street. So I opened the door and got inside. I said to the driver, "let's go to the main street, Sooner the better." The driver turned on his signal to merge into the traffic. It's weird how some people yield to merging traffic, while others ignore them. I think it must be a personality thing, but it's always safer to yield. No need to drive aggressively. The driver drives at a casually fast pace, weaving in and out of lanes as needed. We got to the main street in about 10 minutes. Guess it's time to pay the man. "Thanks, driver, for getting here right quick," I said. I opened the door and got out.
64	driving a car	This morning, I needed to run some errands. I picked up my car key, put it in my bag, grabbed some things I needed to drop off, and walked to the parking lot. I pressed the button on the car key fob, and the taillights blinked twice to tell me my car was unlocked. I opened the door, set some packages in the backseat, and sat down in the driver's seat. It was hot in the car. I turned on the ignition, rolled down the windows, and turned on the air conditioner. It started to feel better after a minute. I placed my foot on the brake, put the car in reverse, and backed out of my parking space. Then I shifted the car to drive, put my foot on the gas, and pulled into the street. There was a lot of traffic on the road, so I turned on some loud music to entertain myself in the meantime. I waited at the red light for a long time. Then it finally turned green, and I was on my way.
65	making a camping trip	We got up early in the morning to drive to the mountains.  We reached the camp ground at around 3 pm.  The first thing we did was find a place to set up our tent.  We found a place which close to the lake.  The spot that we picked had a couple of large trees and a place where we could build a camp fire.  We set up our tent and put our sleeping bags inside.  Next, we went for a walk to gather wood for the camp fire.  We also found some rocks so that we could build a camp fire circle.  After we were finished setting up our camp, we got our fishing polls and went down to the lake.  We caught a couple of fish for dinner.  We put the fish in the cooler and then went swimming for a bit.  After swimming, we cleaned the fish and went back to the camp sight.  We cooked the fish over the camp fire.  Next, we roasted marshmallows.  We sat around the camp fire and talked.  We went to bed around 10:30 pm.
66	making scrambled eggs	My wife and I love to eat eggs, but she likes to eat them fried.  For me, I like to eat them scrambled.  So yesterday, I decided to make some scrambled eggs for breakfast.  I got out a carton of eggs and a carton of milk.  When I make scrambled eggs, I also like to put salt and pepper in it.  I got a mixing bowl and put in about five eggs and a cup of milk.  I put a couple shakes of salt and pepper in it, too.  I got a fork out and mixed the ingredients together in the bowl.  When they were all mixed together, I got out a pan and put it on a stove burner.  I turned it on and put the mixture onto the pan and cooked it on a low setting.  When they were done, I pulled them out of the pan with a spoon and onto a plate to eat.
67	going to the swimming pool	The weather in Louisiana has been brutally hot these past few days so when I found out I was off work today I immediately made plans to go swimming in my neighborhood's community pool. I first made sure my swimming trunks were clean and ready to wear along with making sure I had all my other belongings I like to take out to the pool in one place before I walked over to the pool from my house. I always like to take some sunscreen, an ice chest filled with cold beverages, and a spare towel. I gathered all my things and locked my house up before walking a few blocks to get to the pool. Once I got to the swimming pool I found a nice sunbathing chair to neatly place my personal belongings under and took off my shirt to apply sunscreen on my body. After putting the sunscreen on I was ready to relax and enjoy my day by the pool.
68	packing a suitcase	Today, I'm going on an airplane trip, so last night I packed my suitcase. I thought carefully about everything I would need on my trip. How many changes of clothing would I need? Would I need to bring things like toothpaste, and my toothbrush? I looked through my closet and picked the clothing that I decided to bring with me. I brought my shirts, my pants, my underwear, and my socks. I brought enough for a week's worth of clothes, which is how long I'm going to be staying somewhere else. Then, I went into the bathroom and got my toothbrush and a tube of my toothpaste, so I wouldn't have to get new ones where I'm going. Finally, I decided to pack a few books with me, in case I needed something to do while I was at my hotel. Then, I closed up my suitcase, and was ready to go on my trip.
69	going on a train	I had decided that I wanted to visit my friend Paul whom lives quite a distance away . With this and my fear of air travel in mind I decided to take a train . After researching and finding one online I was well on my way to going to see my friend Paul . I drive to the station and decide that I am going to purchase a round trip ticket as this would be cheaper than just buying both tickets separately . I purchase my ticket and then go to sit down and wait for my train . Whenever my train arrives I have to get in line as they process our tickets . After all this is done I decide to take a seat by the window . I sit and fall asleep a bit as I ride on the train for hours . After a couple hours we finally reach the destination and I get off the train , excited to see my friend . 
70	sending food back (in a restaurant)	I was out to dinner with my boyfriend and we were both very excited because it was our anniversary. We went out to a nice restaurant that both of us had wanted to go to for a long time. We ordered appetizers at first, a cheese plate and some saut¨¦ed eggplant. The appetizers were amazing so we were both so excited to see how our entrees would be. I ordered a rack of lamb and my boyfriend ordered the steak. However, as soon as our server brought the food, I could see that something was wrong. Instead of a rack of lamb, our server had brought me a whole entire fish on a plate! As soon as our server set the plate down in front of me, I politely informed him that I had ordered the lamb and that I did not want to eat the fish. He apologized profusely and quickly brought the fish back to the kitchen. In just a minute, he came back with a beautiful rack of lamb which was delicious.
71	packing a suitcase	Jerry's mom is going on a trip this weekend, so she has to pack a suitcase. She asks Jerry to help her.  Jerry has never done this before, so he sits down on the bed near his mom and asks her what to do.  She says,  "Wait here while I pick out my clothes I will bring." She jumps up and reaches for the dresser.  She opens up the drawers and picks some nice clothes to wear on her trip.  She will also need things like shoes, and toothpaste, shampoo and soap.  So, she has a separate bag for those things, and once it is filled up she puts the clothes in her big bag with Jerry's help.She puts her smaller bag with her soap and toothpaste, into the big bag last. She makes everything really neat and tidy in the bag, and then closes the bag up with the zipper. She puts the bag near the door so that she knows where it is when it is time to go.
72	working in the garden	It is Sunday. I am woken up rather violently by my elder brother, he enjoys this sort of thing, I don't. I asked him why he woke me up this early on a school holiday. He didn't answer and  just gave me a grin.  I tend to sleep till late on the days I don't have school. He said dad told him to and he had work for me. I immediately knew what it meant. I had to go and help him tend the gardens. I was still half- asleep when I reached our garden. And there I saw my dad with a shovel in his one hand and a little plant on the other. As soon as he saw me his eye gleamed. I kid you not his eyes literally gave me a sparkle. He came over to the door and handed me the shovel and the plant. He said since I was 11 I'm a big boy and have to help him and mom around the house and that of course includes gardening. My dad doesn't mind the dirt , but I do. Now I had to spend the whole afternoon helping him around. It sucks.
73	cleaning the floor	Last night, I had a party at my house. Many people were there and most of my friends hung out in both the kitchen and the living room. The living room was fine, but the kitchen was a disaster. I felt the need to clean the floor and in an effort to do so, I took out a mop and mopped up the floor. This took some of the stickiness away and made it feel much better. I sprayed cleaner on the floor before cleaning it and also did some sweeping. This felt good and I was able to clean the floor. After sweeping and mopping the floor, I let it sit for a while so  that I didn't slip on it. It looked shiny and I felt like my house was much cleaner than when my friends came over. Next time, I will follow the same routine when cleaning.
74	ironing laundry	Today I had to iron laundry. Ironing is a way to get wrinkle out of clothes. First I set up the ironing board which is a flat surface to put the clothes on while ironing. I put some water into the iron that turns into steam. Steam helps to take wrinkles out of clothes. Once the ironing board is set up I turn on the iron and give it time to heat up, about 2 minutes. Once heated up I put the pants on the ironing board. I start with the top part of the pants first and move or turn the pants after I iron each side. The I iron the leg part of the pants. I line up the leg part of the pants on the ironing board the way I want so that the crease will be the same. Once done I put everything away. The end.
75	removing and replacing a garbage bag	This morning while preparing breakfast I noticed that the kitchen garbage can was nearly full. After discarding any breakfast waste and checking the room for any extra trash I opened the kitchen garbage can and pulled the full bag from the plastic container. I still had enough room at the top to twist the bag and secure it using a twist tie. I looked into the plastic bin and made sure I hadn't missed any stray items. The bottom of the bag hadn't broken or leaked, that was good news! Now that my trash bag was secure and not going to make a mess on the floor, I walked outside and set the full trash bag out for the garbage collector. I walked back into my home and into the kitchen. First I cleaned the trash container with a paper towel and replaced the garbage bag with a new one.
76	taking the underground	It was my first time in London so my anxiety was pretty high, but I still managed to approach the ticket seller who was actually very nice. The lady sold me a ticket and then directed me through the gate with the turn style entry. I walked down several flights of stairs that had a central corner landing. A man sat cross legged playing guitar, he seemed very happy with his life, I dropped a pound coin into his upside down hat in front of him, he smiled and I smiled back. I continued down the stairs to king's cross and awaited the train I would be boarding. After about 17 mins the train was heard approaching. The train screeched to a halt at the platform on the southbound side where I was. Once all of the patrons exited the train I boarded and sat next to a bald woman with a pet iguana on her shoulders. The subway smelled of urine and B.O. but it was cheap and I liked people watching, especially in a foreign city at thirteen years old.
77	going to the theater	Last Saturday, my friend and I went to the movie theater together. We had been meaning to go to the movie theater for a long time, since have both been anticipating the release of the smash hit "La La Land" for months. La La Land is now finally in theaters, and my friend and I decided that the weekend would be the perfect time to see it. We went to the theater about 30 minutes before the movie started in order to purchase our tickets. We both got adult tickets for the movie. We then waited in line at the concessions stand, because we wanted to buy sodas, popcorn, and candy. My friend bought a Coke and a large popcorn, as well as a bag of Skittles. I bought a Pepsi, a medium popcorn, and a box of Mike & Ikes. After we got our concessions, we went to the movie auditorium. The movie was just about to start as we got to our seats. For the next two hours, we paid close attention to the movie and enjoyed our snacks. After the movie ended and the credits began to roll, we exited the auditorium and the theater.
78	shopping online	The school dance was coming up and I really needed to find a dress and shoes.  I had looked in many stores but still could not find the one that I wanted.  So I decided to try and find one online.  I grabbed my computer and began looking on the Internet for the perfect dress.  I went on a site and typed in "pink dress", because that is the one I wanted.  I looked through many postings but still did not find one I liked.  So I went to a different site and did the same thing.  I finally found a dress that I liked. So, I signed in and payed for the dress. It said it would arrive at my home in a couple of days.  Next, I needed to find some shoes.  So I searched up "silver shoes" and found one that I loved.  I finally found something that I liked and now I could go to the dance.
79	cleaning up toys	A few days ago, my son's room was very messy. There were toys all over the floor, so I decided to have him clean it all up. We started by picking up all of the toys off of the floor and putting them in his toy box. There were several puzzles and games that were open on the floor and scattered throughout the room. We put these back together and and put them away in the game closet. He picked up his books and put them back on the bookshelf. I helped him put his crayons back in their box and put away his other art supplies that were on his desk. We both made his bed together. He put all of his dirty laundry away in the hamper or folded up the clothes that were clean and put them in the dresser. Once the floor was cleared, I vacuumed the carpet. He also helped by dusting all of his shelves.
80	answering the phone	I don't normally receive phone calls on my house phone, I only have one because it came with my home internet package. Today, the phone rang. I didn't hear it at first as I was doing dishes, because I keep the cordless phone in my bedroom on my nightstand. I finally heard it after the third or fourth ring I'd say, and ran into my room to answer it. I wasn't surprised to hear the voice on the other end was a female telemarketer. She was asking me if I wanted to sign up for a credit card. I politely declined, and asked her to please take my name off of her calling list. She agreed to do so, but told me it can take up to 30 days to stop receiving the calls. I told her thank you and hung up the phone. I returned the phone to the charging dock and walked back into the kitchen to finish washing the dishes.
81	feeding an infant	My baby was hungry at around noon, as she is every day. Before eating my lunch, I fed my infant. I first got out the formula from the fridge and poured the normal amount into her bottle. I put the bottle in a pot of gently simmering water on the stove, to warm up the formula. I tested the formula on my skin to make sure it was the right temperature, and took the bottle out of the water when the formula was ready. I held my baby as I fed her the bottle, making sure she was comfortable and could drink well. After she had drunk all the formula, I put the bottle in the sink to clean later and then burped my infant. I held her against my shoulder, over a towel I had put over my shirt, and rubbed her back gently until she burped. After she was done, I put her down, cleaned the bottle, and then had my own lunch.
82	mowing the lawn	Last Saturday, a friend who was visiting my house commented that it looked like I hadn't tended to my lawn in a while. I realized she was right-- the weeds were growing pretty tall, and I hadn't cut the grass in weeks. I decided it was time to mow the lawn the next day. I went to the garage to find my lawnmower. I rolled the lawnmower over to the lawn, and then turned the lawnmower on. It started roaring, signaling that it was on and ready to cut grass. I mowed the grass in neat rows, starting on one side of my lawn and mowing all the way to the other side. I made sure not to miss any patches by going back and forth with the mowing machine. After I inspected my work, I decided I was happy with it. The grass looked much neater. I turned off the lawnmower and returned it to the garage.
83	taking a taxi	It was Friday, finally the precious weekend after a grueling long week of work  had arrived. I knew it would be a waste of precious time to go home and change so I brought a change of clothes with me to the office. I freshened up and changed in the office bathroom. I am so lucky they have a actual shower in here. So me and my friends had already decided which pub we'd hit this week, it was "The Hive". It was named so because it was always "buzzing" with people . Stupid or clever? I don't know. So the four of us , Clay , Justin , Tony and myself had to reach the pub by 8:00. I pulled up my phone to book a cab. First I opened "ola" the app took a lot of time to load probably because the internet speed was slow. After a minute the app finally opened and show no cabs around. Then I opened "Uber" it loaded almost instantly and there were cabs available near me but due to high demand it had surge pricing(more than usual rate). I had no option but to take the Uber at a high price, since we rarely get time to hangout.
84	changing batteries in an alarm clock	One morning Jeff was late for work because his alarm clock didn't wake him up. "It must be out if batteries." Jeff said, "ill go to the store after work and pick up some batteries." Jeff rushed to his job where he was an engineer and he worked with machines. His boss was very upset that Jeff did not show up for work on time that day. so Jeff was told to return to his post and get to work or he will be fired. When Jeff got home from work, he went to the store to pick up some alarm clock batteries. The lady at the store said that they didn't sell batteries and that Jeff should try another store that was close to them. He got back in his car and drove to the other store. He got the batteries and went home. Jeff walked into his room and opened up the alarm clock, he took the old batteries out and replaced them with the new ones. Lastly he closed up the alarm clock and set it for the correct time that he had to wake up for work the next morning.
85	visiting a doctor	When I'm getting ready to visit my doctor, I make sure that I have gathered up any medications or vitamins I have taken that are in addition to my prescribed medications. I also have notes about any other doctors' visits I've had since I last saw my doctor. I make a list of questions about my health that I want to ask. When I get to the doctor's office, I check in at the reception desk so that the staff knows I've arrived for my appointment. I fill out any paperwork they need and then wait my turn in the waiting room. When the nurse or doctor calls me, I go into my designated treatment room. While I'm waiting to see the doctor, the nurse may weigh me, take my temperature and blood pressure, and ask some general questions about my health. When the doctor comes in, he or she asks me how I am and why I scheduled an appointment. If I need to undress, the doctor leaves the room while I do. During the examination, the doctor may check my vision, hearing, reflexes, breathing rate and heart rate. Depending on the reason for my visit, the doctor may perform other, more specific procedures to diagnose and treat diseases, injuries and other conditions. The diagnosis and treatment are noted in my chart. He or she may also prescribe medication and other treatments. At the end of the visit, I redress. The doctor or a nurse may give my final instructions, and then walk me and my chart back to the reception desk, where I can schedule another appointment if I need to and pay for my visit. Once I finish at the reception desk, my visit to the doctor is over.
86	making omelette	Omelettes make a great breakfast, and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook. First, I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl. I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories. I begin beating the eggs with a fork or a whisk. I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor. I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan. I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I don't want them to stick. I let the pan sit for a bit so the egg mixture heats up a bit on one side. As this occurs, I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture. Really, almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette. I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle. I then flip the omelette over several more times to lightly brown it on both sides. It is then ready to serve!
87	mowing the lawn	Last week, I decided that it was time to start mowing the lawn for the season. I got the mower out of the garage and put it out back. It was heavy to lift over the weather so I needed help from my dad to lift it. Although this was difficult, I was able to lift it and bring it to the yard. Once I got to the yard, I started to turn it on and mow the lawn. I went up and down each row of grass slowly. I noticed everything getting cut and I continued to mow the lawn. Upon finishing, I took the lawn mower back inside and lifted it back over the washer and dryer and into the garage. Overall, I felt that this process was smooth and easy, but yet still time consuming. The whole process took almost an hour for a small yard then.
88	having a barbecue	My family and I decided to host a barbecue for our neighborhood. It was the Summer time, the perfect weather for a barbecue. We invited most of our neighbors and most of them graciously accepted. Some of them declined as they were busy during the planned time of the barbecue. We decided to make the food of choice burgers and hot dogs. Most of the people at he barbecue were pleased with the food choice. My kids were fairly entertained as a lot of people in my neighborhood have kids as well, so they had plenty of friends to play with at the party. We also told everyone to bring swimming gear as well as we had just recently opened up our pool. I'm sure the most of the kids enjoyed that. Everyone said that the food tasted amazing and that really pleased me. Everyone had an enjoyable time as the barbecue went on into the night.
89	making a hot dog	Earlier today I decided that I would like to have a hot dog for lunch. The first thing I did was check the kitchen to make sure that I had hot dogs, buns, ketchup, and chips. When I was ready to cook lunch, I took my indoor grill out from the cabinet, plugged it in, and waited for it to heat up. While I waited for the grill to heat up, I set my plate with a bun, a handful of chips, and 2 pickles. Once the grill was ready I placed the hot dog on the grill and closed the lid. When the hot dog was halfway done cooking, I opened the lid and turned the hot dog around, so all sides would be equally browned. After the hot dog had finished cooking, I removed it from the grill and put it on my bun. Before eating my hot dog, I unplugged my grill, and wiped it down with a wet cloth. After I finished that, I was ready to eat my hot dog. I squeezed a small amount of ketchup on top of my hot dog and took my plate to the porch to eat. I enjoyed eating my hot dog, chips, and pickles. W I was finished eating, I brought my empty plate inside and rinsed it off.
90	cleaning the bathroom	The bathroom needs to be cleaned today. I am going to need some supplies to clean the bathroom properly. These supplies include a broom and a mop to clean the floor. I will also need a scrubber to clean the sink and the bathtub. The last thing I will need is a special soap also called a cleaning product. Cleaning the bathroom can be a really dirty job. First I'll put on some big rubber cleaning gloves. These special rubber gloves will keep my hands from getting dirty. First I will clean the sink out with water and soap. Next I will scrub all of the dirt away with the scrubber, water, and the soap. Then I will use a special toilet bowl brush to clean the toilet. Next I will sweep the floor with the broom. Lastly I will mop the floor. Now the bathroom is sparkling clean again.
91	checking in at an airport	I had to go on a business trip to California last week and I needed to fly there.  I took a cab to the airport with my carry on and suitcase.  Once there, I went to my airlines check in desk and waited on line to check my suitcase.  There were lots of different people on the line, from business men and women like me, to families, even a high school band.  When I finally reached the desk, a representative for the airline was there to help me.  She was very cheerful and helpful, and I was able to put my suitcase up on the conveyor belt and watch it join other suitcases on their way to the airplanes.  I was even able to switch my seats because there were available seats still left on the plane.  Once I was all confirmed, she printed out my boarding pass and I was able to continue on to security and then onto my plane.
92	vacuuming the carpet	Today my carpet in the living room was looking a little dirty, so I decided to vacuum it. I went to my closet where I store all of my cleaning supplies, and took out my vacuum. I wheeled it to my living room and unwrapped the electrical cord that was attached to the vacuum. I plugged in the cord into a wall socket. I then turned on a switch on the side of the vacuum and the vacuum turned on, making a loud noise! Using my arms, I moved the vacuum back and forth across the dirty carpet. I made sure to clean every single area on my carpet. Once I was satisfied with how clean my carpet was, I turned off my vacuum. I unplugged the cord and wrapped it back around my vacuum. I wheeled it back to my cleaning closet and put it away in it's rightful place.
93	sending party invitations	I wanted to send invitations to 25 people I hoped would come to a birthday party for my boyfriend. I drove to a store that sells different types of cards, including packages of invitations. There, I found some festive-looking cards that would be ideal for this purpose. I chose three packages holding 10 invitations each. I paid for them at a cashier's counter. After driving home, I filled out each invitation in ink with the necessary information and signed my name. Then I wrote out the envelopes by hand with each person's name and address. I had to use my address book to find the information or else I needed to look it up online if I didn't have the details. When this task was complete, I placed a postage stamp in the upper-right corner of each envelope, then licked the adhesive on each envelope before pressing the flap down to seal it. The final step was to bring all the envelopes to the post office the next day and place them in the box for outgoing mail.
94	cleaning up toys	Yesterday morning, I was walking and I tripped on some toys.  My daughter had left them out and so I got her and we started to clean them.  We picked up the tambourine and put them in a box that we normally keep it in.  I grabbed her xylophone and put it up in a closet where it belongs.  We got a box where we keep her LEGO's and put all of the little pieces in there.  After all the pieces were picked up, we needed to put the containers away.  One of the boxes was put on the shelf.  Another box was put underneath my daughter's bed.  After we had put all of the toys away, we needed to make sure they were all picked up.  We looked around the room and couldn't find anything else that needed to go back into a container where it can be put away.
95	throwing a party	I was invited to so many friends and now it is my time to throw a party. I wanted to do it efficiently and wanted to introduce new items to my list. First I thing I did, made a list of friends I wanted to invite, then I called them and made sure most of them will be available. It was success because it was on memorial day, most of the people were coming. Then, I made a list of items which I wanted to make. I sort out my list to what I will need from market. Once I had them all, I started to to make preliminary preparation, so at lat moment I will not have to rush. I marinated some meat, that I was going to bake. Some of the stuff, which I needed to fry, I made and freeze them. I made dessert 2 days  in advance, so I was done with it. Last thing I had to do is, made all accessories ready  like spoons and plates and drinks and dishes. Time arrived and everything was ready.
96	making a flight reservation	After I was married, my new wife and I wanted to travel to Disney World in Florida.  We had to get there by a plane, so we decided to reserve some tickets.  To do this, we looked up prices online during the time that we wanted to go.  We found some ticket prices that were good, so we decided to buy some tickets.  We went to the website of the airline and read all of the conditions we needed to follow in buying a ticket.  We clicked the dates on a calendar of when we were going to need to be flying to and home from Florida.  The total amount of money we needed to pay appeared on our screen.  We put in the info of our credit cards and then the money was given to the airline.  The tickets were now saved for my wife and I to fly.
97	sending food back (in a restaurant)	I went to a restaurant with my grandpa a couple of days ago.  It isn't a restaurant that has very good food or very good service, so I wasn't sure if it would be good.  When I ordered my food, it took a long time to get out to me.  When the food was finished and I took my first bite, my burger was very cold.  I tried to get a hold of the waitress who brought us our food.  I asked her kindly if she would be able to make sure that I had a burger that was warm.  She apologized for everything and told me that she could have a warm burger ready for me in just a few minutes.  After about ten or so minutes, the food came back out to me and it was a lot better tasting this time around.  I'm glad I asked for a new one.
98	papering a room	I work as a painter for a living. Sometimes people want wallpaper which I do not like, but the customer is always right. First I put a coat of primer on the wall so the paper will apply nice and smooth. Then I have to cut and measure the paper. I have a special machine that lets me roll the paper out to the length I need and then cuts it in straight lines. Then I have to put glue on the paper. I apply it to the back of the paper then stick it on the wall as evenly as I can. I use a paint knife to smooth out any bubbles in the paper. Then I wipe off any excess glue with a wet sponge. Now it's time for the next piece. I repeat the process and make sure the pattern lines up. I repeat until all done.
99	going dancing	When my wife and I were dating, I asked her to go dancing with me.  There was a club in the city that had line dancing on Saturdays.  I picked her up one of those Saturdays and took her to the club.  There was a fee we had to pay to dance of about 10 dollars.  After we got in, the music started to get really loud and we got really excited.  We jumped out into the dance floor and started to dance with each other.  We would stomp our feet and clap our hands.  We would twirl around and jump around.  It was a lot of fun for us and we got really thirsty.  We went to the side of the floor and got a drink that was over there.  She said she had a lot of fun but was tired, so I went and dropped her off at her house.
100	going on a date	Last week, my boyfriend and I went on a date. First, we went out to dinner at a local restaurant. It was a new Indian cuisine place called "Lazy Garden." We chose the restaurant because it had vegetarian options for me and meat options for him. He had a few kebabs and I had an Indian and Asian fusion salad. After finishing dinner, we went to a movie. We saw a special showing of older movies on modern screens. We saw "Jaws," and it was very interesting to see a movie that came out before we were both born on the big screen. We both jumped when the Jaws jumped out of the water as we nibbled on our Goobers and Sour Patch Kids. When the movie was over, we drove to a local park and just talked as we stared up at the stars. It was the perfect ending to such a romantic night.
101	working in the garden	When I was a boy, my dad loved to teach me how to make a garden.  He first told me about when to plant the plants.  He then told me which plants would do really well in the area that we lived.  We prepared the ground by towing it with a machine.  The machine turned the dirt around and made sure that it was fresh to be planted.  We took out seeds and spaced them apart to give room for the plants to grow.  We watered them every day after that and made sure that they didn't get run over by weeds or bugs.  When the fall came around, my whole family went outside to pick the plants.  We picked out the corn and peas and beans.  My dad and I cut the melons off of the vine and we ate those while we finished all of our work out there.
102	baking a cake	I like to cook a lot but I am not a very good baker . So I never bake cakes from scratch . However I do like cake a lot so I do bake them . I use box mixes . They are easy to use and make a very nice cake . it really does n't take much time . All you need to do is get one bowl . Add the cake mix from the box . Either 2 or 3 eggs added to the bowl . Then a half cup of oil and finally about a cup of water . Then you need to get your mixer and put it on medium and mix it all up for 2 to 3 minutes . Then put it into a non stick cake pan and bake for about 30 minutes . So all together about 10 minutes preparation and 30 minutes baking you can have a good tasting cake in 40 minutes . . I do n't really like frosting so as soon as it cools I cut myself a slice .
103	going to the swimming pool	I love water, anywhere. It attracts me big deal. We were planning since so long. So finally, we got good deal on groupon, and decided to go in group. It was 1 hour from our house. We left house around 9:30 and reached there before 11. It opened at 11. So it was perfect. WE started with lazy river, and then with small slides. and then in wave pool, big slides and rides in boat slide which was falling from above, and splashing water all around. There were couple of water slides , which were kind of risky. If someone is not careful, they can get hurt. But over all, it was good. Best part that food was included in ticket. We went to  slide which one was above the water and falling in to 12 feet water. Kind of scary but we did it. It was literally hitting our body.
104	going to the theater	Saturday night I went to AMC Cinema Theater with my friend Sally. It is the local movie theater in town that just opened up. Me and Sally walked in to the savory smell of popcorn being popped and the colorful lights all around the lobby of the theater. We gave out ticket stub to the worker and walked to the counter to buy some popcorn and and slushy for each of us. After we walked to the hallway where our movie was showing at. We sat in our seats and watched the movie. It was a hilarious comedy and it was really funny. After the movie was over we walked out the theater. As we walked to my car we were laughing on the way out talking about the parts of the movie that were the funniest. We both agreed it was a great movie and we both had a fun time.
105	wrapping a gift	To wrap a gift, I would gather supplies like wrapping paper, tape and scissors. I would unroll a portion of the wrapping paper on a large, flat surface, like a table or the floor. I would put the gift in a box to make it easier to wrap, especially if the gift is an unusually shaped object. I would wrap the end of the wrapping paper around the gift so that there is a little extra room at both ends. I would use the scissors to cut the wrapping paper from the rest of the roll. Then I would fold the wrapping paper over the boxed gift until the two ends of the paper meet. I would use a piece of tape to keep the wrapping paper in place. I would then fold the ends of the wrapping paper toward each other so that the whole box is covered. I would use several pieces of tape on each side to make sure the paper stays attached to the box.
106	changing batteries in an alarm clock	One day, I woke up for work and was shocked because it was light outside. This meant I was late for work! I looked at my alarm clock and realized that it was totally blank. My alarm clock had died! I quickly called my boss and explained why I would be late, and made sure to make a note in my phone to stop at the store later to pick up some replacement batteries. On my way home from work, I pulled into the hardware store to pick up some batteries. However, I realized that in my rush that morning I forgot to look at what kind of batteries I needed! I took a gamble and went with a pack of AAA batteries. I was anxious when I drove home because I didn't want to have to go back to the store. When I got home, I realized that I had gotten the right batteries! I quickly changed the batteries in my alarm clock and tested it to make sure that it worked. It did, and I made sure to always change my batteries every three months so I would never be late for work again.
107	washing one¡¯s hair	When I woke up this morning I decided it was a good idea to wash my hair. I gathered a towel and some clean clothes to wear after I was finished. I took off what I was wearing and stepped in to the shower. I turned on the water and let it run for a few seconds to get warm. I adjusted the water temperature until it was how I wanted it. I like to use warm water but not hot as hot water can dry out your hair and skin. I put my head under the shower head and thoroughly wet my hair. I opened the shampoo bottle, poured a quarter-sized puddle of shampoo in my hand. I rubbed my hands together for a second to spread the shampoo over them and then rubbed the shampoo in to my hair. I rubbed the shampoo around in my hair to make sure it got everywhere. I put my head back under the shower head to wash out the shampoo. I rinsed my hair until there was no more shampoo. I turned off the shower, used a towel to dry my hair and skin and got dressed.
108	mailing a letter	One day I was thinking about my grandma who lives in Florida.  I thought it would be nice to write her a letter.  I sat down at the table and took out a pen and paper.  I wrote to her telling her all about the things going on in my life.  I told her about how I went to my friend's birthday party and how I was looking forward to my vacation in August.  I told her how my friends and I planned a trip to Washington D.C. for vacation.  I signed the letter and folded it up.  I carefully placed the letter into the envelope and addressed it to my grandma.  I put a stamp on the letter and I walked down to the post office.  I gave my letter to the postman and he put it in the mail to go out the next day.  I bet Grandma will be excited to get my letter!
109	making soup	For dinner last night I decided to make some Tom Kha soup.  It was a cold November evening, and I was getting over a slight cold.  Soup always makes me feel better in these situations.  I always find Tom Kha to be especially good as a cold remedy.  I had already been to the grocery store and gotten all the ingredients I needed.  I chopped up some lemongrass and ginger and started cooking them in some chicken broth with lime leaves.  While this was simmering, I chopped up some chicken, and placed that in the pot as well.  Then I added the coconut milk, fish sauce, and mushrooms.  I let it simmer for a while to let all the tastes blend. I occasionally tasted the soup, and added extra seasonings until it tasted just right.  The Tom Kha made a very tasty dinner.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.
110	cleaning the shower	Before I started cleaning the shower I removed everything that was sitting in the shower like shampoo and body wash and sat everything on the toilet seat. I blocked my dogs from getting in, turned on the ventilation fan and pulled tucked the shower curtain behind the toilet tank to get it out of the way. I sprayed everything with foaming shower cleaner so there was a thick layer of foam coating the walls, the sides of the tub and the bottom of the tub. I let it sit for a few minutes to soak in and then I used a sponge with a scrubber on it to scrub all parts of the shower, some areas have a lot of hard water stains so I had to scrub even harder. After I have scrubbed everything clean I stood on the side of the tub and turned the shower on cold water, I moved the shower head around to rinse the walls. I aimed the water stream to push all of the foamy water down the drain. When I was done rinsing I left the ventilation fan on and closed the bathroom door so it could dry.
111	wrapping a gift	It was 2 days before my friend Marc's birthday. I had already bought his present, but it still needed to be wrapped. So, I went to Walgreen's, and purchased some wrapping paper. I then came back home and got the gift that I bought for Marc out. I set the gift down next to the wrapping paper. I then opened the wrapping paper, and pulled out enough paper to cover the entire gift. I used a pair of scissors to cut the paper at that length. I then put the paper on the floor, and placed the gift in the center of the paper. I then began to cover the gift with the paper, by folding each side of the paper until it was over the gift, then I would take another side and do the same, until all sides were covering the gift. I then used tape to keep all the folds neatly together. Marc's Gift was now wrapped.
112	making a flight reservation	Today I wanted to plan a plane trip to see my grandmother.  She lives in Portland, Oregon, and I live in Birmingham, Alabama.  I decided to get on my computer and look up flights from Birmingham to Portland.  I got online and searched cheap plane tickets in my web browser.  Several websites popped up, and I chose Travelocity.com website to search.  I clicked on the link that said, "Today's Flight Deal" .  I chose the option of taking a round trip flight, then I filled out that I would like to leave from the Birmingham Airport and arrive at the Portland Airport.  I selected that there would be one adult on this trip.   I have the third week of June off of work, so I decided to leave on that Monday morning. I searched to see what flights were available, and picked the one with the earliest leave time.  Then I was asked when I would like to return to Birmingham, and I chose a flight that would return me back home.  Once that was selected, I was told I could continue with my booking and add my personal information like name, phone number, and credit card information.  It was very easy, and I'm excited to be going to see my grandma soon!
113	visiting a doctor	Yesterday, I went to a doctor appointment. My doctor's name is Dr. Jane who asks her patients to call her by her first name. My appointment was set for two weeks ahead of time for a follow up. I got to the office ten minutes early in case I had to fill out any paperwork. I entered the lobby and approached the front desk. The desk nurse greeted me and had me sign in with my name and doctor I was there to see. She told me I could sit down to wait so I found a chair near the front to sit. I didn't have to wait long and was called to the back by the head nurse. The nurse first took my weight, then my temperature and blood pressure readings. She said everything was fine. Next, she had me follow her to the room where the doctor would see me. Once there she had me sit on the bed and asked me how I was and if I had any symptoms. After taking a blood sample she left the room. I waited for 10 minutes and Dr. Jane came in. After a short discussion, she said the antibiotics had done their job and that my vertigo was all cleared up. After thanking the doctor I paid my fee and was even given a sucker with my receipt which made me smile. Finally, I left the office. I felt good about my appointment and felt relieved that I was no longer ill.
114	folding clothes	It was a standard Saturday morning for me when I decided that I should do laundry.  The weather was bright and sunny and I thought it would be a great day to take my dog to the park with me.  There was only one important chore for me to get done before I could up my friend and see if her and her companion wanted to come along - laundry.  I made sure to just do the bare necessities for the coming week so I didn't waste much time then came the decision of whether or not to fold it immediately or wait until later.  I figured with such a small load, I could get away with folding it and putting it away rather quickly, and that's what I did.  Folding my clothes left me with one less thing to worry about and we were all able to be nice and relaxed on such a beautiful day.
115	cleaning the shower	One day I went into my bathroom to take a shower. There was a lot of gunk on the walls and hard water build up around the shower head. I decided it was time to clean the shower before things got worse. I went to my cleaning supply cabinet and took out some cleaning spray, paper towels, and a scrubber. Before I removed any grime from the shower, I took out all of my shampoo, conditioner, and other items from the shower. Whatever was empty or I never used, I tossed out. From there I sprayed down the shower with the cleaning chemicals and let it sit for a while. After that I got in there with the scrubber and scrubbed until there was nothing left on the tiles. On the more delicate things, I used the paper towels to wipe down. Once all was clean, I used the removable shower head to rinse down the shower walls and tub. Once clean, I returned the remaining shampoo bottles, etc. and put away my cleaning supplies.
116	unloading the dishwasher	I had started a load of dishes in the dishwasher before I left for the store. My dishwasher is very loud so I don't like to be home when it runs.  The dishwasher was quiet, and a green light indicated "clean" so I knew the dishes were done.  I opened the door of the dishwasher, and slid the top rack out.  The top rack was full of glasses and mugs and Tupperware containers.  I stacked the glasses and mugs two-by-two and put them in a cabinet.  The Tupperware containers still had a bit of water in them, so I put them in my drying rack to air out.  Then I slid open the bottom rack, which had many plates and bowls, as well as a case of silverware.  I took the silverware out, placing each utensil in its proper drawer.  Then I took out the bowls and plates and put them up above in a cabinet.  I felt accomplished having finished a chore.
117	walking a dog	When I get home from work, I like to go walking with my dog.  He's a brown and black German Shepherd, and he's really nice and polite to strangers.  I get his leash and head to the door, and he's already waiting for me because he saw me getting the leash.  I put the leash on his collar, open the door, and we're off!  We walk down the block, stopping every so often so he can sniff around and see all his favorite sights, then start to head home.  On the way home, sometimes we see one of my neighbors who is also walking their dog--I'll stop and talk with him for a few minutes while our dogs say hello and play around for a few minutes.  After that, we'll go back to my yard, and he'll potty before going back into the house.  I'll close the door behind us, then take the leash off his collar before he goes running back into the house, looking for some other fun thing for us to do.
118	writing a letter	Tim wrote a letter to his cousin last night . He took out the paper and pen, wrote on the letter a message to his cousin, how much he missed him.  It took a while for him to write, but he told all about the summer, what he did over school break, what he has to do next semester in school, and how many years he has to go to school to be a doctor.  He told his cousin that he wanted to come visit as soon as possible, so they could go fishing, and swimming again that cool lake in the mountains.  He was tired of studying, and working all the time.   After he finished writing the letter, he folded it up, and put a stamp on the letter. He addressed it and put it in the mailbox for the post man to come get it. He knew he would hear soon from his cousin, and that made him happy.
119	making a bed	Making a bed in a hotel as a cleaning maid consists of stripping off the linens. The blanket  & cover are not washed unless really bad. The linens are picked up for the laundry. There are two flat sheets. The first flat sheet is spread across the bed and tucked tightly using a special fold so it won't undo itself. The send flat sheet is spread out, then the blanket.  Folding the top edge over the blanket, both are tuck between the mattress and spring board. Pillows  are put into clean pillow sacks and the top cover is laid over and tucked under the pillows. Some motels put a mint chocolate on the pillow but most don't. A real fancy hotel would have a flat sheet on top of the blanket as well as below it because that isn't washed everyday. Hotel beds can harbor bed bugs and fleas in the mattress itself.
120	attending a wedding ceremony	Today was my sister's big day she was finally marrying her long time boyfriend. When we arrived at the wedding we saw many family members outside taking pictures of the people that were there. We entered the church and signed the guest book and put our gifts to them on the table by the book. We went to the room the wedding was taking place in and found a seat to wait for the ceremony to begin. After a few minutes everyone was at their seats, the groom and the wedding party was at the alter, and it was time to begin. It was finally time for my sister to walk down the aisle. In front of my sister was a flower girl walking down the aisle and tossing flowers on the floor. When she made it to the front the music started and everyone stood up to see the beautiful bride. She walked down the aisle with her dad so he could give her away. Her and her now husband said their I do's and the ceremony was over.
121	cleaning up a flat	I was living in my very first apartment of my own, and my parents were coming to visit. However, the apartment was very dirty so I needed to clean it up quickly before my parents got there. I started with the kitchen. I put all of the dishes in the dishwasher and ran it. Then, I wiped off all of the counter tops and made sure that everything on the counters was neatly arranged.  I then moved onto the bathroom. I quickly scrubbed out the toilet and the bathtub, and wiped down the bathroom counter. I also made sure to clean the mirror. I moved onto my bedroom. I picked up all of my clothes off of the floor, rearranged the items on my dresser, and made my bed. Finally, I went to clean the living room. I quickly vacuumed the living room floor and straightened up the pillows on my couch. I did one final look around my apartment and was satisfied that it was clean.
122	making a flight reservation	It's the end of the year and it's time for my holiday vacation .  Every year at the end of the year I take the last two weeks of the year to visit my family and we go on vacation somewhere new. This year we want to visit Brazil.  I am in charge of booking the flight  and planning the who trip. I go online and make the flight reservations to a two way from LA to Brazil. We plan to stay for over a week and I book a small tour guide to the main points to see in the country.  I know each of my family's preference when it comes to seating in the plane and which rooms they prefer to stay in. I always search for the best deal on or flight tickets and look to save most of our money for our actual trip.  We like to enjoy ourselves and spend quality time with each other, making new memories.  I can't wait for our trip.
123	checking in at an airport	I had been on a trip to Boston, and it was time for my flight home.  I arrived at the airport ninety minutes before my flight was scheduled to leave to insure I had sufficient time to check in, pass through security and make it to the flight gate.  I had confirmed my reservation ahead of time and printed out a boarding pass which I took with me to the airport.  When I arrived I had luggage to check.  Since I arrived in with enough time I checked my bags at the check in counter.  There was a much shorter line for people who already had their boarding pass.  They gave me receipts which I would need to claim my luggage at my destination.  I put the receipts in my wallet so I would not loose them.  Next there was a line for the security screening.  I patiently waited in the line with the other passengers.  It took 30 minutes to get through the line.  At the screening check point they verified I was not carrying any dangerous items.  I was now able to to to the gate where my plane would depart from.  I had 20 minutes to relax before my flight left.
124	renovating a room	Last week, my girlfriend and I decided to renovate our basement.  We wanted to make it look new and fresh.  First, we took pictures of it and spent some time looking at the pictures, deciding what we wanted to keep and what things we wanted to change about the room.  We then made a list of things we needed to buy at the store to accomplish this renovation.  We went to the store with our list and bought the items we needed.  We came back home and began working in the basement.  We worked together and removed certain things first.  Then, we painted the basement walls together.  After that, we waited until the paint dried.  Then, we hung pictures on the walls that we'd bought.  We then placed a few items like a couch and large TV that we'd bought in the basement.  We added our new carpets too.  Finally, we put the popcorn machine in the corner of the basement and our basement looked new and fresh!  We were excited but tired so we both plopped ourselves on the new couch and napped together happily.  Our basement had been nicely renovated indeed!
125	making tea	When I got up this morning I was very tired. I decided that I needed something to help wake me up before I started my various activities for the day. I went to the kitchen and took my electric water kettle to the sink and filled it up with enough water to make a couple of large cups of tea. I then put the kettle back down on its base and pressed the start button so it would begin to heat the water up. In the meantime, I found my favorite mug in the cabinet where we keep the mugs. It was in the very front. I like it because it is big and it has cartoon pictures of owls on it that are cute. I took the mug over to the counter where the kettle was a put it down. I then opened up a box of Earl Grey Tea and pulled out a tea bag and placed it in my mug. The kettle then let me know the water was ready by beeping loudly. I poured the water until the mug was about two-thirds full.  I then set a timer for four minutes to give the tea enough time to steep. I like to set a timer because I sometimes forget and end up with cold tea! When the timer went off, I pulled out the teabag with a spoon and placed it in the trashcan. Then I put a packet of sweetener into the tea. I then took the almond milk out of the refrigerator and put enough of the milk into the tea until it turned a lighter color. I put the milk away and got a spoon. I stirred the  tea to make sure it was all mixed well. Then, because I was being impatient, I got two ice cubes and placed them in the mug of tea to cool it off some. I stirred the tea until they melted and then put the spoon in the sink. I turned off the kettle and left the kitchen with my mug of tea. I sat down at my computer and began to drink it happily. It came out perfectly.
126	taking the underground	When I lived in Spain, my friends and I decided to go to Madrid for a weekend. We knew that Madrid had a very good and easy subway system, but none of us had ever taken it before so we were a little bit nervous. We got off the bus and quickly found a subway map so we could get to our hotel. After looking at the map for awhile, we decided we needed to take two different trains to get to where we needed to go. We got on our first train and everything went smoothly. However, after we got on our second train, we quickly realized we were headed in the wrong direction! We got off  at the next stop and switched to the other side of the subway station so we could get to our hotel. We finally made it to our hotel and laughed about taking the wrong train by accident.
127	flying in a plane	I was excited to be going to Cancun in two weeks . I brought my tickets a few months before , and when the day arrived , I simply printed out the ticket from my computer . I brought my two suitcases filled with clothes and necessities , along with my visa and other important travel documents . Once I got to the airport , I passed by security and they checked my bags for anything that was illegal or dangerous . Once I got past the checkpoint , I waited at a terminal for an hour . They began to call for my plane and I got on line . I gave the lady my visa and ticket and I boarded the airplane . I put the luggage above my head in the luggage department and sat down . My seat was next to a window so I was very happy about that . Soon a person sat down next to me . We were told to eventually put our seat belts on as we were ready to fly . We watched a short video on what to do in case we felt some turbulence and what to do in case of emergency . Then the airplane lifted off and I was scared at first , I felt some shaking but eventually we were in the air and everything was okay . Eventually they began to serve food . That was my favorite part . I love airplane food ! 
128	writing a letter	I didn't know how to start it. Didn't even know what to say. Should I meet her in person? Should I call? These are questions I've been asking myself. In the end I decided to write a letter. "Hello" I wrote. My pen stopped. Sweat beads coming down from my forehead. Should I just come out and say "I love you"? No, no that's too direct. Maybe I should start with some small talk. OK that's what I'll do: Hello, Nice weather we're having today huh? I'm not a fan myself but what do you think? I didn't know how to contact you whether in person or what so I just decided to go old school and write you a letter. The truth is that I've always loved you. Ever since I saw you years ago I have been so incredibly and madly in love with you. I just had to get this off my chest.
129	putting up a painting	I got the best present yesterday! My little boy painted me a picture of him and me next to a rainbow. He did a really great job on the painting and he was very proud of his master piece. I knew I needed to hand it in a very special place. He and I walked around the house with the painting and looked for the perfect spot. We looked in the living room, the kitchen, the playroom, and even the bathroom. We finally decided it would look best in my bedroom. That way I could always see it and it would be with me. We took the painting, a nail, a hammer and a tape measure and headed into my room to hang it up. We measured the wall and chose a good spot to hang it. I put the nail in a little and let my little boy hammer it is, too. We hung the painting on the nail and it was the perfect touch that my room needed.
130	packing a suitcase	When I went on my last vacation, I first got together all of the clothes that I needed to take on vacation. I then put it all together and figured out how much extra I needed. I sorted everything nicely in the bag as a planned exactly what items I wanted to bring with me. Soon after I packed my clothes, I started to pack other items such as deodorant, toothpaste, cologne, etc. This was easy, but as my suitcase  started to fill up, I felt like I had to start making room for everything. As a result, I made room for everything by using all of the compartments of the bag and taking out some clothes that I didn't need. This was a difficult process because I wanted to make sure that I packed enough for the vacation, but not too much to the point where I wouldn't be able to carry it around.
131	taking a taxi	Last night we went out with friends and needed to take a taxi home. First off we needed to find an available taxi. Once we found one we all hopped inside the taxi. We told the taxi cab driver where we wanted to go. There was a lot of traffic so it took a long while to get back to our hotel. Once we were at our hotel the taxi driver let us know what our total for the ride was. It came out to $15.00. My husband decided he would pay for it since some friends paid for our last round of drinks. We paid the taxi driver and all exited the taxi. We were very glad we found a taxi to take us home instead of walking the whole way. It was a very easy decision to make since we were all tired and it is a very big city!
132	cleaning up toys	The kids' bedroom was a mess.  There were toys everywhere.  I knew it needed to be cleaned before someone fell and hurt themselves.  I got on the floor and started to pick up the blocks.  They all went into one container by themselves.  Next were the books.  I put them back neatly onto the bookshelves where they belonged.  Then there were the dolls.  The kids have a special hamper where they put all their dolls.  I threw the dolls into the hamper.  The dolls accessories were next.  They belonged in a plastic container near the doll hamper.  The room was almost clean.  All that was left were the toy cars.  I picked them up and tossed them into a bin that we keep under the bed.  When all the cars were gone, I rolled the bin back under the bed.  The next time it was dirty, they would have to clean it themselves!
133	making a dinner reservation	Every Saturday night my family and I go out to eat at a restaurant. Saturday nights are busy at restaurants, so we have to make a reservation earlier in the week. This means you tell the restaurant when you are coming to eat, and they agree to have a table ready for you. Some restaurants let you make your reservation online, but for others you have to call and speak to a host or hostess. This Saturday, my family wants to eat at our favorite Greek restaurant. This place doesn't have online reservations, so on Wednesday afternoon I called and spoke to Maria, the hostess. I asked Maria if my family of four could make a reservation for 6pm on Saturday, but that time wasn't available. Maria told me we could eat at 4:30 or 7:30 instead. 4:30 is too early for our dinner, so I picked the 7:30 reservation.
134	playing a movie	After I had selected a DVD disk for my collection that contain the movie that I wanted to play, I removed the disc from the container, and flipped it over to the reflective side to see if there were any scratches or fingerprints that would interrupt the movie while it would be playing in the DVD player. I used a cotton ball that had been slightly soaked in rubbing alcohol to clean the reflective surface of the DVD, wiping side to side and up and down instead of in a circular pattern in order to avoid deepening any pre-existing scratches. Once I have removed all of the fingerprints and smudges, I used a dry paper tile to remove the excess alcohol and any strands that may have come off the cotton ball. Now that the DVD is ready to be played, I push the power button on the DVD player. I push the open button to release the cartridge that holds the DVD disc inside of the player. When the cartridge was ejected, I saw that there was a DVD that had already been inside the player, so I removed the DVD from the player, and placed it to the side. The DVD containing the movie that I wished to watch was in my hand, and I placed it into the same cartridge I had just removed the other DVD from. I then pushed the open button on the player again, and the cartridge automatically retracted back into the player with the DVD. As I heard the DVD player spinning the disc, I picked up the remote control to get ready to push play once the video had finished loading.
135	cleaning the table	My table has gotten all sticky from dinner, so it is time to clean it. Cleaning the table helps make the table last longer and keep bugs out, so it is good to do. Some tables can be cleaned with a wet rag, but some tables are especially dirty so they need cleaning chemicals. My table is really dirty and made of stone so I find a good cleaning spray to use on it. The spray I chose is good for stone and doesn't hurt it, and it also gets rid of the stickiness and dirt on the table. I spray the table with not too much of the chemical, and then use some paper towels to rub the table. I make sure I rub the whole table and rub off any dirt or stickiness. After the whole table is rubbed off, I make sure there are no chemicals left on the table and that it is dry. My table is nice and clean again.
136	going to the theater	John was going to go to the theater with his friends during the weekend. He was very excited to spend time with his buddies and was looking forward to it all week. He was going to to go his favorite type of movie, a Spiderman movie. He saved up some money to spend at the theater for a drink and some candy and popcorn. He was splurging on himself but he was determined to have fun. He went to the movies with his friends when the time came and had a great time. The movie was a good movie and the food was good. He was super happy he went and had a good time with his friends. He didn't regret going with his friends to the movies. He went home that night after the movies and he wrote a review online to tell everyone about how good the movie was after he saw it. He gave it a good review.
137	visiting a doctor	This past month, I ended up coming down with some sort of illness. At first, I wasn't sure what it was, and searching the symptoms online gave me too many results to pinpoint just one illness. To avoid stressing myself further, I decided to visit my doctor. I scheduled an appointment with her over the phone to see her as soon as possible. Thankfully she would be able to see the next day. I went to the clinic the next day and told the receptionist  about my appointment. After a few minutes of waiting, my doctor saw me in her office. After a few different tests, she was finally able to give me a proper diagnosis. She told me that I had come down with bronchitis, and gave me a prescription for some medicine. I took this prescription to the pharmacy next door, and after an hour was able to get my medicine. I took this medicine for about 2 weeks, and before I knew it, I felt much better.
138	making coffee	John loves coffee.  He loves coffee so much, that he goes to a special coffee shop to buy a very expensive bag of coffee every single week.  His favorite part is making the coffee, and smelling the coffee through his whole house as it is brewing.  When he gets home from buying the coffee, he pulls out the coffee maker, puts water in the pot, and pours just the right amount of coffee grounds into the filter at the top.  After the water and coffee is in the coffee pot, he turns it on, and sets it to perk.  Once it starts, you can hear the coffee brewing, the water heating, and the water being forced through the coffee grounds.  It starts to smell like the best coffee ever, and John is happy.  When it finishes, the coffee maker beeps, and he knows it is finished.  He pours himself a cup of coffee, and adds his cream and a touch of sugar.
139	cleaning the shower	Judy came home and walked past the bathroom. She noticed the shower was looking a little grimy. Going straight to the kitchen, she grabbed everything she would need to deep clean the shower. A bucket, a sponge, shower cleaner, a baggie for trash, a scrubbing pad, and a large bucket. Going in, she started by running the shower on very hot to wet down the whole shower area. Being careful not to burn herself, she waved the shower head back and forth to get all the corners wet. Then, she sprayed the shower cleaner all over the shower and organized her counter while she waited a few minutes to let it soak in. Using the sponge, she scrubbed and scrubbed to get all the build up off. She then turned the shower back on and rinsed all the tile and the fixtures, using the sponge now and again to spread the water around. She put all the debris in the baggie, and threw it away in the kitchen. Standing back, she gave herself a tiny pat on the back for the gleaming bathroom shower she was leaving behind.
140	going on a train	Last weekend , I took the train into the city with my younger brother to attend a concert . We drove to the train station to catch the 4 PM train . It took a while to find parking . Once we boarded the train , we took a seat . The train conductor came by and we purchased 2 round trip tickets with cash . The ride to the city took about an hour . Many people got on and off at every stop . I enjoyed the people watching . There were many different types of people , the business types , students , families , and coeds . There were a couple loud babies and annoying blondes as well . It was very loud . After about an hour , we were almost to our stop . Once we arrived , the train pulled into the system and the conductor announced that it was the last stop and that everything had to depart . We walked onto the platform and into the train station , then were on our way . 
141	making a bonfire	Last night I invited some friends over to my house. It was a nice evening so we decided to build a bonfire. First, we cleared a patch of grass and built a large circle made of big rocks. Next we put some logs around the circle of rocks for us to sit on. Then we went into the woods to gather some dry tree branches and dry leaves. We then put them inside the circle of rocks and made a large pile. We lit a match and put it into the large pile, so the branches and leaves caught fire. It made huge flames, which were nice and hot to sit by. We then sat around the bonfire, told stories, sang songs, and roasted some marshmallows. In a few hours, the fire began to die out, but it allowed us to have a good night. After the bonfire was out, we left and went to bed.
142	going grocery shopping	I love going grocery shopping ! Usually I am going with my ten month old son while my husband is at work . before I go , I make a list of what we need or else I will buy things that I do not need . I check sales to make sure I get the best deals on things and make a meal plan . Then I get my son in the car and we drive over the the grocery store . We get a cart and I put my son in it . I give him a toy and secure it to the cart after I wipe it down to make sure its clean , and we enter the store . We go through the store and using my list grab what I need . Since i usually go two or more times a week , I only spend about 3 minutes there before I have all we need and can pay . Then we go back out to the car . I put my son back in his car seat and the bagged groceries in the trunk and head home . 
143	throwing a party	Yesterday was my daughters birthday and my sister and I threw her a surprise birthday party for her 13th birthday.  I invited our families and her friends over two weeks ago to give them plenty of time to arrange to come.  I ordered a birthday cake in the number of 13, representing his new age. I purchased gifts which she had hinted to wanting and a few extra's also. I also purchased decorations, paper plates and cups and party favors. I sent her to spend the night with her best friend, whose mother knew what was going on and while she was with her friend I prepared the house for her party.  My daughter was expected to be home at 2;00 the next day and I went to work on placing everything where it needed to go.  All of our families and her friends started gathering to the house about 1:30.  When she arrived home we were all in the living room, surrounding her cake and presents.  The party began and my daughter was very happy with what transpired.
144	painting a wall	When I was young, my mom had an obsession with painting the walls of our house. As soon as she finished painting one room, she would start on another. We were in this never ending flux of wall colors. Her most ambitious project was painting her bedroom in an unconventional way. Instead of using a roller and painting the walls a solid color, she would dab a rag in the pan of paint and repeatedly press it against the wall, creating a unique textured look. The problem was, her bedroom was huge, so this took months and enlisted the help of me and my siblings. The first time I tried it, I did all of the dabs in a really uniform way, so each looked like the other. This was not how she had painted the rest of the wall, and so my section stood out and looked very different from the rest. She didn't paint over it or anything, so for the remainder of the time that we spent in that house, that section of wall looked completely wrong and out of place.
145	visiting a museum	I wanted to see some art, so I decided to visit a museum. I picked up my friend Ryan from his house and we drove together to the museum of art in the downtown area of the city. We paid for our tickets at the front and received wristbands. We then walked into the main room of the museum. We wandered around for a while, taking the stairs to different floors and walking into all of the different rooms. We saw paintings in some rooms, sculptures in others, and some rooms had special exhibitions going on. When we became tired, we stopped at the cafe to enjoy a cup of coffee and a snack. After resting at the cafe, we looked at a few more exhibits and watched a video about the museum in a screening room. After this we were ready to leave, so we walked out to the car and drove home.
146	taking a driving lesson	I get into the driver's side of the car and the instructor sits next to me in the passenger side.  I put on my seat belt, adjust my rearview mirror, and make sure I can reach the pedals and steering wheel comfortably.  I put the key in the ignition and turn on the car.  The instructor asks me to drive around to the back of the building, where we will practice parallel parking.  I shift the car into Drive and press on the gas pedal gently with my foot.  I carefully steer the car to the back of the building.  I take my foot off of the gas pedal and use it to press down on the brake pedal.  The instructor has me park between two orange cones next to the curb.  One I have done this to his approval, I shift the car to Park and turn it off.
147	repairing a bicycle	The other day , my best friend and I were riding to his house . When we were almost there , I noticed that the front tire on my bicycle felt rather wobbly and was most likely flat . I was in luck however , as my friend had a bicycle repair kit and some spare tires . Once we arrived at my friend 's house , I asked my friend if he let me borrow his bicycle repair kit . First , I turned the bike over and removed the front tire and tube . Next I filled the tube with air to check where the tube was damaged , and found a small glass shard which had punctured through it . After making ensure the tube was fully deflated , I repaired the puncture in the tube by using glue and applying a patch on top , then slid it back onto the tire using my hands . Next , I placed and pushed the tire back onto the tube . After which , I reconnected the tire onto the bicycle . Finally , I pumped air into the tire until it was filled up and the bicycle was ready to be ridden again . 
148	mowing the lawn	I look out my window at my front yard and notice that my lawn is growing a little too tall. I think it is time to mow it. I check the sky for rainy clouds to make sure it will not rain soon, and also check the Internet for any rain later today. It will not rain today, so it is safe to mow the lawn on my lawnmower. My lawnmower has a motor and a seat for me to ride in, so it is much easier to use. I go into my garage to make sure my lawnmower has enough gas to work. The lawnmower has plenty of gas and is in good shape, so I turn the key and start its engine. The lawnmower doesn't cut the grass unless you pull the lever that controls the blade, so I pull that lever and start to drive the lawnmower over the grass. I make sure the grass is being cut after I drive over it, and carefully steer the lawnmower over all the tall grass in my yard until the grass is cut.
149	sending party invitations	When sending party invitations, I think it is important to first pick an invitation that reflects the theme of the party. For instance, if the theme of the party is a Hawaiian luau, then I would pick an invite with palm trees and tropical flowers. I think it is a wise decision to write out a list of people whom I  want to invite beforehand so that I do not leave anyone out. On the invite, I include information such as when and where the party is. I also include what type of attire people should wear so that people are dressed appropriately for the party. These day, it is much easier to send party invitations through electronic means on the computer such social media or email. It also saves money on stamps, and I do not have to write out the addresses on the envelopes by hand. After sending out the invitations, I sit back and wait for people to r.s.v.p. to tell me whether or not they will be able to attend my party.
150	taking a taxi	Tom needed to go to work so he went into his car.  Unfortunately, his car would not start. He needed to get to his work before he is late. He was scared he would get fired by his boss. He then looked online to find a taxi.  He called them and they came. He was ecstatic but the taxi driver had two other passengers in the car. Tom got worried but the driver told him not to worry. Tom had to wait. The cab driver drove the two other passengers to their destination without a problem. By that point, his job was about 10 minutes away. He was going to back it on time. Suddenly the taxi driver realized he was low on gas. He then went to the gas station and tom was getting more and more impatient. He told the driver to hurry it up and not go to the gas station. The cab driver still filled his tank and tom made it in the nick of time.
151	taking a driving lesson	I was finally able to get my driving permit and it was time for my first driving lesson. I was so excited to meet my instructor and drive their car for the first time. I got behind the wheel made sure I checked the mirrors so I could see everything around me. I put my seat belt on and told the instructor to put theirs on too. I adjusted my seat so I could reach the pedals and steering wheel comfortably. It was time to put the key in the ignition and start the car. After the car was on I checked the mirrors to make sure I would not hit anything and backed out the parking spot. He instructed me to drive the car around the block to make sure I knew the basics of driving. After he felt comfortable we went out onto the road. We drove for a few miles before going back to the school.
152	washing one¡¯s hair	I was on the way to my girlfriend's house. I decided to look as sharp as I can for her. I have plan a surprise date just the two of us which I have already made reservation. I decided to stop by the barber shop and have my hair cut, washed and dye.  The barber did a good job with my hair and putting the dye in. I was please with the progress he was making between finishing up and my reservation time. The last step was rinsed, washed and rinsed. After lying back in the chair I continued looking at my watch. Shortly the barber said I'm all finish. I said thanks you. I went outside get into my car. I felt something wet as I lean back, it was my shirt soaked in the back. I was so upset and disappointed. I rushed back home to change shirt, by the time we made it, my reservation was taken. My afternoon was ruined due to a simple hair wash.
153	renovating a room	I decided to renovate my guest bedroom.  The walls were a pale beige; I decided they would look better as a bright blue.  I went to the hardware store and found a color of paint that I liked.  I asked a friend to help me move all of the furniture away from the walls and take down all the pictures.  We put down tarps on the floor so that paint did not get everywhere.  I put down painter's tape along the molding so that they did not get painted.  It was a lot of work but we got the room painted in a few days.  Once the walls were dry, I painted the molding along the floor with fresh white paint.  I got inspired after the painting and set up a new set of wooden shelves, painted the same white as the molding.  Then we moved the furniture back around until the room looked nice and fresh.
154	going to the sauna	I was feeling a little stressed out so I decided to go to the sauna.  I needed to go with someone so I asked my friend to go with me.  We showed up together in our swimming suits and with some extra clothes and a towel.  When we got there, we talked to a clerk that said that it would cost 10 dollars for us to use the sauna for 30 minutes.  We agreed to pay and got out 10 dollars for each of us to pay for the time.  We got a key to open the door and we opened it up.  There was a tray that had hot coals on it and we poured water on it to get the room really steamy.  We sat in there in our swimming suits and relaxed in the heat.  After we were done, we turned the coal burner down and left.
155	renovating a room	My husband and I just bought a house.  The house we bought is a little bit of a fixer upper.  The living room was the first room that we wanted to renovate.  The first time we did was move everything out of the room.  Next, we went to the store and picked out paint.  We painted the walls a beautiful blue and then we had to pick out new flooring.  We decided on hardwood floors.  We ordered the wood, but had to hire a contractor to put the flooring in since we couldn't do it ourselves.  The contractor came in and had the job done within a day.  Once that was done, we put up new curtains and brought in new home d¨¦cor.  We put the furniture back into the living room and added different personalized touches like pictures to make the room just right.  It was a lot of work, but totally worth it!
156	making fresh orange juice	It was summertime and I was very thirsty. I wanted to drink orange juice very badly, but I did not have any orange juice. Luckily I had an orange tree in my backyard. I picked some good and ripe oranges to juice. In the kitchen, I brought out my electric juicing machine and plugged it in. I washed the outside of each orange to make sure my juice did not get dirty. Then, I cut each orange in half and turned the juicer on. This kind of juicer worked by spinning a plastic piece inside the juicy part of the orange when you held the orange against it. The juicer squished all the orange bits inside the peel and turned it into juice. The juice came out the side of the juicer from a spout and poured into a glass that I had put there before. The juicer was very good at its job, and removed all the seeds from the juice that came out for me. The orange juice was fresh and tasty.
157	cleaning the floor	The kitchen floor was filthy after our big cookie baking marathon, so it was time to clean it.  After all the cookie baking mess was cleaned up, I took the vacuum cleaner, plugged it in to an outlet and vacuumed the floor being careful to get under the edges of where the counter stuck out.  I made sure I sucked up all the crumbs and other dirt before I unplugged the vacuum and put it away.  Next, I found the mop and mop bucket and carried them to the kitchen sink.  I let the water run until it was nice and hot, measured half a cup Lysol floor cleaner into the bucket, then filled it half way with hot water.  I placed the bucket on the floor, dipped the mop in to get it soaking wet, lifted it out of the water and kept it over the bucket, pulled down on the handle to wring out the extra water.  I started mopping the floor, rinsing the mop in the bucket every few minutes until I had reached the doorway.  I rinsed the mop once more, wrung it out and stood it on the kitchen floor propped up against the wall while I took the bucket out to our gravel driveway to empty it.  After I rinsed the bucket, I put it and the mop away.  The floor looked much better.  Time to eat some cookies!
158	driving a car	I love to drive. About 6 months ago I drove to a town about 100 miles away. The day before I made sure I had a full tank of gas and that the car was clean inside and out for the trip. I left on my trip in the morning. I was glad the car was clean and full of gas so I would not have to do all that stuff right before going on the trip. It was a Saturday morning and not too much traffic. I live in a city. It took about 45 minutes to get out of town. I like driving safely and giving plenty of room ahead of me and the vehicle in front of me. You never know when someone will do something stupid and I will have to swerve out of the way. On my trip everyone drove safely and I did not have to swerve out of the way.
159	making omelette	I was very hungry one morning, so I decided to make an omelette. I grabbed ingredients out of the fridge, which was three eggs, a red onion, a green pepper, and a red pepper. I pulled out my cutting board and a knife and diced up the onion and peppers. Once they were diced, I got a pan out and put it on the stove top and turned on the stove. While it heated up, I cracked three eggs into a bowl. I stirred the eggs thoroughly. When the pan was heated, I put the peppers and eggs into the pan. I let them simmer for about three minutes before mixing the eggs in. I turned the heat down and let it cook. When it was about half done, I flipped half of it onto itself. I covered the top and let it sit until it was done. I turned off the stove top and put the omelette on a plate. It was delicious!
160	folding clothes	It was a Tuesday night at my house, which meant one thing-doing the laundry. I put the clothes in the washer and went about some others tasks before switching them to the dryer. As the dryer played its song to indicate that it was done drying the clothes, I picked up the laundry basket and headed to the laundry room. I pulled out clothes and put them in the laundry basket and carried them to my room. I turned on the television so I would have something to watch while folding. I first folded all of my shirts and put them in one pile. After that I folded all of my pants and put them in another pile. I then matched and rolled all of my socks just the way I like them. I then repeated this process with my husband's clothes. When I was finished folding the clothes I put them all away where they belonged.
161	removing and replacing a garbage bag	The garbage bag in the kitchen was completely full, so it was time for it to be taken out to the trash bin. First I removed the plastic bag from the garbage canister so that it would slide out of its. But before removing the bag, I pulled on the yellow drawstrings that was once holding the trashbag over the canister securely, but now will be used to close the garbage bag. From the two holes that I could see the yellow ribbon, I pulled at the yellow plastic which drew the top of the garbage bag closed once I was satisfied with the tightness, I tied the two yellow stripes into a not to secure the closure in place. Using the dotted yellow plastic straps, I pulled the bag of words while using the other hand to pool the canister downwards. This separated the canister from the garbage bag, and I took the full and close garbage bag out the door and put it in the trashcan. I came back into the house, reached under the cabinet and grabbed a brand-new, empty trashbag. I unfolded it completely, and placed the bottom of the garbage bag into the bottom of the trash canister. I opened the yellow handle that is woven into the top rim of the garbage bag, using the yellow to guide me as I fitted the bag around the rim of the canister. Now the new trashbag was inside and ready to be used.
162	playing a movie	It was Saturday night and I had expected my best friend to come over later, we had previously made plans to get together and watch a movie. As I turned on the TV, I put a bag of popcorn in the microwave to get ready for my friend to come. I heard the doorbell rang, and greeted my friend who came in with some boxes of movie theater candy. As I led her to the couch, she sat and I ran back to the microwave to get out the popcorn. I got the biggest bowl I could find, and dumped the bag of pooped kernels into the bowl. I showed my friends a few options of movies we could watch and she picked out a new comedy. I opened the DVD player, took out the disc and put it in. I sat down next to my friend on the couch and pressed play on the remote.
163	sending food back (in a restaurant)	I went to my favorite restaurant and ordered a chicken salad, something I had never gotten before. I waited patiently for my food. When it came, it looked really good. I took a few bites and something seemed off. It seemed too salty, and the chicken was a bit cold. I thought about just eating it, but decided it would be better to send it back. I waited for our waiter to return. When he did, I explained that my meal wasn't very good. I told him the chicken was served cold and the dressing was far too salty. He apologized and offered to get me a new one. I agreed. He went to the back and had the chef make me a new chicken salad. When it came back out, the chicken was hot and the dressing was not salty at all. Overall, I was very happy that I sent it back.
164	making omelette	Omelettes are one of my favorite breakfast foods, so I grabbed a skillet's from the pantry, place it on the skillet and turned on the heat to medium in order to get ready to cook them. While the skillet was heating up, I cracked two eggs, and the and the contents of the shell into an empty bowl and discarding the white cells. I beat the eggs until the yoke and egg white had combines, then added a few splashes of milk and continued beating. Once I was satisfied with the consistency of the egg of the omelette, then I prepared the contents that will go inside. I already had a bacon that have been cooked previously, so I crushed the bacon with my hands in order to make crumbles. I also grabbed a bag of cheddar cheese from the refrigerator, as well as an onion. I cut a few slivers of onion off, and chop them into fine pieces. Now that I have all of my ingredients prepared, I pour the egg into the preheated skillet and let the egg cover the bottom surface of the skillet. Once I felt the ad was halfway cooked, I use a spatula to lift and flip the egg over to the other side. Immediately after flipping the egg, I placed my crumbled bacon, diced onion, and shredded cheddar cheese on one side of the circular cooking egg. I then use my spatula to close the omelette, flipping the uncovered side of the egg on top of the bacon, cheese and onion that was situated on the other side of the egg. Once the egg was properly closed, I then use a spatula to turn the omelette over so that it may continue cooking on the other side, and turning off the heat. After about 40 seconds of cooking, I then use a spatula to remove the omelette from the skillet, and place it on the plate so I can begin eating.
165	making coffee	Yesterday morning, I wasn't feeling like I had a lot of energy.  I was at work in the diner and I was really hoping to get a drink of coffee.  Someone came in and I waited their table and they asked for coffee.  I went to the kitchen and there wasn't anything left, so I had to make it myself.  I got all of the ingredients I would need together to make the coffee and brought them to the company coffee machine.  I placed a new filter in the coffee machine and a new pod that the machine uses to make the coffee.  Once it was done, I poured the coffee out into a mug.  I placed a couple spoonfuls of creamer in the coffee, as the person had asked for.  I took the coffee out to the customer and they told me thanks for making it just right for them.
166	making omelette	I woke up at 7 am this morning. Then went straight to the loo, then while I was half asleep, I decided what to have for breakfast. It was gonna be an omelette , a mushroom omelette. But I had no eggs at home. I could have  eaten cereal for breakfast but decided to have omelette since that is what I had decided. So I went for a  quick walk at 7:30 to the nearby shop. I bought a dozen of eggs and was at home by 7:40. I heated up the pan , poured some oil and sauteed the mushrooms , at the same time I broke open two eggs , added some milk , salt , chilies, garlic to mix and whipped it good. When the mushroom was nicely I sauteed I added the eggs. I let it set and flipped it. Enjoyed it with nice buttered toast and a big glass of orange juice.
167	attending a wedding ceremony	Last year on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, I went to my friend Eric's wedding with my partner. The wedding was outside on the Art Institute terrace at 10am. When I arrived at the wedding, I was greeted by Eric's parents who were very nice, friendly, and welcoming. Once my partner and I found our seats, we said hello to our friends and also met some new people. After about a half an hour of socializing, it was time for the ceremony to begin. It was a beautiful ceremony. I cried because I was so happy for Eric and his partner. After the ceremony, it was time for brunch. We had the choice of biscuits and gravy or pancakes. I chose the biscuits and gravy dish. We were also served an assortment of family style sides, like bacon and home fries. It was a really fun wedding and I enjoyed myself.
168	writing a letter	I have relatives that live very far away from where I do, and unfortunately they don't have access to the same technologies as me, so I can't communicate with them over the Internet. For some time, we've had to do it the old-fashioned way - by writing letters to each other. After enough time would pass since one of them would send me or my family a letter, I would begin to work on one. I would write for a few minutes, usually talking about things that my family recently did, and asking them how they've been doing. If possible, I would even attach pictures to the letter, so they could see what we've been up to. I would then close up the letter in an envelope, stamp it, and write on their address. The next morning, I'd drop it in my mailbox for the postman to pick it up and take it to the post office. Usually, they would write back within a week responding to my letter.
169	making tea	We are having a tea party! Megan and Veronica are at my house today. Megan lines up all the chairs while Veronica slides the table over to the kitchen. Mother puts hot water into the kettle and sets it on the stove. We gather all of the plastic cups from our grocery store play set and put them on the table in front of the teddy bears. Then we sit at the big table and wait... "Wheeeee" said the kettle as mother scurries over to take it off of the stove. Gives up each a teacup with little flowers on it, and then puts a tea bag in each one. The teddy bears will have to pretend. Then she puts a dish with sugar in it on the table, too. When she pours the water into our cups, the teabag turns the water brown! It's like magic. Then when we are done making the water brown, we take out the teabags and plop a little bit of sugar into our cups. Then we stir it and sip our tea. I love tea parties with Veronica and Megan.
170	packing a suitcase	My family and I are going on a trip, so I need to pack my suitcase. First I thought of where we are going so I know what kind of clothes I need. We are going to the beach so I know it will be hot. I took my suitcase out and opened it. I started by putting my sandals and extra pair of shoes towards the bottom. Then i packed my nice and folded pair of pants and some shorts also. Next came some shirts for the daytime, to go swimming, and to sleep in. Then I packed my underwear and some socks. I put my big beach towel folded on top of everything so it would fit. I thought what else I should take. Then I remembered I need sunscreen so I went to get it and put it on one of the side pockets of the suitcase. I also got my toothbrush and a small toothpaste tube and put those on the side pocket. Last I got my water goggles and packed those in too. I made sure all the zippers closed so nothing falls out and I was ready to go on our trip.
171	going to the dentist	My dad told me that it was time for me to go to the dentist.  We went there once every year and it was now time to go there.  I got in my car and I drove down to the dentist's office.  I got checked in and they asked me to wait a while until the dentist could see me.  While I waited, I looked at things on my phone and some of the magazines that were there.  They called my name and I went back to a small room with a chair that I rested in.  The assistants came in and cleaned my teeth with some of their tools.  It was a long time to keep my mouth open, but I knew it was for the best.  The dentist came in and told me that I didn't have any cavities and that I was good to go back home.
172	feeding an infant	The first order of business in feeding a baby is to make sure he's hungry, because if he's not hungry, he's not going to eat.  In our case, it's been a while since the baby last ate, and he's getting a little ¡°fussy,¡± so he's probably hungry.  (It's probably time to change his diaper, too, but that's another story.)  His Mom is at work, but she left some milk in a bottle in the refrigerator.  So the first thing to do is set the baby down in a safe place.  We'll put him in his monkey chair and strap him in.  Then we need to pour some water in the bottom of a pot, put the pot on the stove, turn on the heat, and put the bottle with the milk in the water at the bottom of the pot to heat up the milk.  After a bit, we remove the bottle from the water and flick a little milk on our wrist to make sure it's warm but not too hot.  When the milk is just the right temperature, we turn off the stove, remove the bottle from the pot, remove the baby from the monkey seat and head for the couch.  Then we cradle the little tyke, show him the bottle, and let him do the rest.  When he's finished, turn him face down over your shoulder and pat him a few times to let him burp if he needs to.  Mission accomplished.  Go change his diaper.
173	playing tennis	I was bored and wanted to play a game. The weather was very nice outside, so I decided to play tennis in the park with a friend. I put on my running shoes since I would be running around a lot on the tennis court. Sandals would not have been safe to run that much in. I brought my tennis racket and some tennis balls to the park and met my friend there. We went into the court and each picked a side of the court. I was on the left side of the net and my friend was on the right. It was my turn to serve, so I threw the ball I was holding up and hit it over the net. The ball bounced on the floor past the net and my friend hit the ball back to me. I was fast and jumped up to hit the ball before it hit the floor. The ball whizzed past my friend and he could not hit it back. I scored a point. I won the game a few minutes later after we hit the ball back and forth some more.
174	washing clothes	So it was finally weekend. It is the time to clean the house and wash the clothes. So I went to my basket where I usually put all my dirty cloths that I wore during weekdays. I grabbed the basked and brought it to my washer and dryer machine. I took out detergent from closed above. Added one cup of detergent in machine tray of washer and I also added cloths softener in the tray besides the detergent tray in my washer machine. Then I set it up the machine timer to one hour. I started the machine and then I waited for one hour while watching TV. Then I removed clothes from washer machined and put in in dryer machine, I set the timer to hour and again waited for an hour while watching TV. I heard the beep when drying was done. So I went back to machine and remove dry clothes from it and put it in a clean basket. And that is how my cloth washing session ended.
175	washing dishes	I looked at my sink which contained a ton of dirty dishes that needed to be washed and put away. I removed the dirty dishes from the sink and plugged the drain. I turned the faucet on and let the sink fill with water as I poured in a decent amount of dish soap. The bubbles from the soap rose up to the edge of the sink. Once the sink was full, I turned the water off and placed the dishes into the water. I grabbed a wash cloth and put it into the water to get it wet. I repeatedly scrubbed each dish and rinsed them off in a stream of cool water. Then I placed them on a drying mat I had placed next to the sink. Once I had washed every dish and rinsed each one, I grabbed a towel from the drawer and dried each one off. I placed each one in the cabinet where they belonged.
176	taking the underground	Busy city like New York, it is wise to take underground transportation. We were in long island area. We wanted to go to see statue of liberty and surrounding attractions. We are not so familiar with the area, and we are just visiting the place. SO we called the front desk where we were staying. They helped us and gave the schedule for subways and underground transportation. We wanted to leave around 10. So I look and there was a train which was leaving 9:50. We got ready before time, and there was a bus which dropped us at the station. We had to walk on bridge which took us to the other side and eventually we took stairs to go underground to catch the train. It was crowded, but train was on time. It stopped there for only couple of minutes. We got on and reached our destination on time.
177	taking a shower	I woke up this morning and I decided to take a shower right away.  I got out of bed and went to my dresser to get all of my clothes for the day out of the drawers.  I took them to the bathroom with me to change right into after the shower.  I got undressed and got a towel ready so that I could get dry fast when the shower was over.  I turned on the water in my shower with my right hand and waited for the water to warm up a little.  When it had, I went into the water and got wet everywhere.  I started to put soap on my and waited a minute while it cleaned my body.  I rinsed my body off from the soap and I was ready to get out.  I walked out of the shower and dried off with my towel I had prepared.
178	making coffee	I was the first person up in my house on Saturday morning, so it was up to me to make the coffee.  I took a container of French vanilla from the pantry along with a clean filter.  I measured 2 tablespoons of coffee into the filter.  I removed the filter holder from my coffee machine and put the clean filter with the french vanilla coffee into it, relishing the aroma.  I clicked the holder into place.  Then I took the glass carafe from the machine and filled it with cold water.  I poured the water into the area above the filter and turned the machine on.  I could hear the water heating and within a few minutes hot water was running down over the coffee grounds and then dripping into the carafe.  When all the water had run over the beans, I poured some into my favorite mug and added a little bit of cream and some sugar.  I left the rest for my family to enjoy when they got up.
179	paying bills	Mary took the check book out of her purse and put it on the kitchen table. Fred took the stack of mail from by the door and put it by the check book. Both of them grabbed a pen from the drawer by the kitchen phone, and sat down at the table to begin discussing how they were going to pay all the incoming bills for the months to come. Fred had been laid off for two weeks at the beginning of the month, so things had been a little tighter than usual. Mary wrote checks for the household bills; cable, water, electric, gas, and sewer. Fred wrote checks for home and entertainment; the mortgage, all the credit cards, and any shopping bills for clothing and groceries. They both preferred to work in silence, and enjoyed the moment when they had addressed and stamped all the envelopes, then went outside to put them in the mailbox together. Fred kissed her when they got to the front door.
180	cleaning the bathroom	Today I realized that my bathroom was too messy, so I decided to clean it.  I started with the tub, first rinsing everything out and wiping it down with a rag.  I then took a spray bottle of tub and tile cleaner and vigorously scrubbed it into every inch of the tub.  I made sure to wear eye and mouth protection while doing this, so I wouldn't get hurt myself.  Finally, I rinsed the cleaner off of the tub to make the entire area sparkling clean.  After cleaning the tub, I found a scrub brush for the toilet, along with some toilet cleaner, and scrubbed the inside of the toilet bowl.  I used tile cleaner to get the outside of the toilet, before wiping it down with a clean rag.  The last thing I did was get a damp rag and wipe down the sink to make the bathroom nice and clean.
181	going to the dentist	Today I had an appointment at the dentist. I left my house and drove myself to the dentist's office. I entered the building and went to the front desk where the secretary was sitting. I said hello, told her my name and confirmed my appointment. She said thank you and to take a seat in the lobby and that someone would call my name when the dentist was ready to see me. I sat down in a chair in the lobby and started reading a magazine. Ten minutes later I heard someone call my name. It was a woman who was dressed in hospital scrubs and she said she was the assistant to the dentist. She introduced herself and showed me what room to go to. I entered the room and was introduced to the dentist. I then sat down in the chair and had my dental check up. They had me open my mouth and inspect my teeth. I also got my teeth cleaned. After they were finished, my appointment was over. They said goodbye and I had went to the front desk to check out and tell them I was leaving. I then went to my car and drove myself home.
182	cooking fish	The fishing day went really well and Allan was looking forward to his dinner of freshly-caught, fried fish.  He had filleted the fish as soon as he returned to the dock and now he rinsed and dried each fillet. He took some saltine crackers and crushed them in a plastic bag, using a rolling pin. He poured the crumbs onto a plate. He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour. Next, Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water. With a fork, he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together. Allan put a large frying pan on his stove and turned on the burner. He added oil to about a half an inch. While the oil was heating, he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish. He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs. He turned the fish and pressed on the crumbs until the fillet was coated. He then carefully set the breaded fillet into the hot oil. When the edges of the fillet were starting to brown, he took tongs and carefully turned the fillet over. In just a few minutes, the bottom edges were also browning so he removed the fish from the pan with the tongs. He set the fish on some paper towels to soak up the excess oil and then moved it to his dinner plate.
183	making a flight reservation	We decided we would go to Florida for our vacation. We wanted to fly because it would take a very long time to drive there. We figured out the day we would leave, and the day we would come back. Then we went online to see what airline we might take. We looked for airlines that had flights from our city to Florida on the days we wanted to fly. We made a list of those possibilities on the computer. Next we compared the prices, because we did not want to pay too much. We found the one that had the lowest cost and selected that one. We typed in our information, like our name and phone number and email, and then we paid for the tickets with a credit card online. We printed out the receipt and the directions for how to get our tickets and boarding pass. We would need to take those with us when it was time to go to the airport to leave. Everything was ready fro our trip, now that we had made the flight reservations.
184	answering the phone	Talking on the phone has always been a regular part of my life. I use the phone every single day to talk to my parents, and occasionally to talk to my friends and other relatives. Just last week, I got a phone call from a friend that lives in my old home town. It was about the middle of the day, and I heard my phone ring. The phone number was unknown to me, and the only thing I recognized was the area code. Because of this, I answered the phone and was pleasantly surprised to hear the voice of one of my good friends on the other line. Once I knew that it was in fact one of my friends, we talked on the phone for about 2 hours just trying to catch up with what we've been doing. By the time I hung up the phone, I was happy knowing that I got to talk to an old friend.
185	giving a medicine to someone	I once had to give cough medicine to a child who was sick. The child had been coughing for several hours, and was having pain in his chest from all of the coughing. I went to the medicine cabinet and found a bottle of cough syrup. I ready the directions printed on the side of the label, and determined the amount of cough syrup to administer. I also got a small, clear plastic medicine cup out of the cabinet to measure out the amount of syrup to pour based on the child's weight. The child needed two tablespoons of the syrup according to the directions, so I poured out that amount into the cup and gave the cup to the  child to drink. I encouraged him to completely drink the cup of medicine so that he would have relief from his coughing. Afterwards, I rinsed out the cup, put the lid on the bottle, and put it back in the cabinet.
186	visiting the beach	This past summer, my family went on vacation to San Diego. One of the reasons that we like going to this city so much, apart from all the things there is to do, is going to the beach. We would always make sure to pack some beachwear or swimwear with all of our normal clothes because of this. We would all go to the beach dressed in our beachwear, so that we wouldn't have to worry about finding a bathroom to change in. There was so much fun things to do there when we recently went. One of the things that me and my younger brother did was buy some molds from a nearby shop to make sand castles with. Another thing that I did was sunbathe, with a beach towel to lay down on while I felt the sun on my skin. My brother and my mom actually went into the water, something that I've always been nervous about doing. After we'd had enough, we dried ourselves off with the towels, hopped back in the car, and went back to our hotel room.
187	going to the swimming pool	I went to the swimming pool at the local YMCA recently. I decided to go towards 1 PM since there would be less people there. I do not like sharing a lane. Even though sharing is caring, I find it to be crowded in the pool and distracting sharing a lane. I drove to the YMCA, about 15 minutes. I then parked my car and went inside. I then changed into my bathing suit. I proceeded to swim for about 35 minutes. Mostly just the front crawl, and back stroke. I also used the kicking board for about 200 meters or 4 laps of a 50 meter pool. Finally, I finished my swim. This YMCA has a hot tub so I then soaked in the hot tub for a half hour to relax my muscles. I then went back to the locker room, showered, and changed back into my work clothes before leaving.
188	folding clothes	John was just finishing up drying some clothing in the dryer when he heard the machine beep. He was ready with a hamper for his clothing and was going to fold all of his laundry that he washed. The clothing smelled really nice and he took a big whiff of the freshly washed and dryed clothing. He then stuffed them into the hamper and took the hamper in hands and proceeded into the bedroom. He placed the hamper on the bed and started to fold his clothing. He started with the shirts and continued to fold them. He made sure they were folded nicely and put them in a pile to put in the dresser. He then proceeded to fold his socks. He just shoved one matching sock into another and put those in a pile. He continued folding his laundry, he finished folding his underwear, jeans, and everything else he needed to fold. He put them into the dresser and continued about his day.
189	answering the doorbell	I live in New Orleans so I don't answer my doorbell unless I know someone is supposed to be coming over. If there is a random unexpected ring, it goes ignored. Because it might be a bad person looking to do me harm. When I have dinner parties though I do answer the bell. I hear the bell ring from way back in the kitchen. I know the bell mean a guest is here and it's time to go to the front door. Then I have to walk through the house dodging guests and their drinks and food. When I get to the door I fling it open with abandon for I am having a party and I suspect the person on the other end is a friend and not a foe. I welcome the person in after I've told them to stop ringing the bell repeatedly. My friends are obnoxious that way.
190	renovating a room	I walked into my living room, and thought to myself about how it looked. The room was boring, and had a couch that did not feel good to sit on. I decided to fix the room up, to renovate it. I sold all the furniture I did not want in the room and started fresh. I painted the walls a color that I liked much more than the old one. I bought some curtains that looked nice over the windows in the room. The curtains looked good with the walls too. I also bought a nicer couch with money I had saved up, one that was nice and soft and felt good to sit on. There were also some lamps that looked good on a table in the room that I bought. The last thing I decided to do was hang some art on the wall behind the couch, which made the room look very good. I had finished my renovations.
191	feeding a cat	I feed my cats soft food every morning and evening. They have a bowl of dry cat food and fresh water available to them all the time. I buy large packages of soft cat food in the cans at the grocery store and keep a lot of it so I always have it for the cats. When it is time to feed them I get out three clean dishes and open three cans of food. Sometimes the cans have a tab to pull on them and other times I have to use the can opener. After the can is open I put one can of food on each dish and use a fork to mash it up and spread it out. The cats know I am getting their food ready as soon  as I pick up the can so I don't need to call them. They stand beside me and wait until I put their food down for them. I put the dishes of food on the floor and the cats eat. When they are finished I pick up the dishes and wash them so they are ready for next time.
192	packing a suitcase	I had a big international trip coming up so I decided to carefully plan what I needed beforehand so that I wouldn't be overloaded with luggage. I went through my schedule paying special attention to what I was doing each day. I then made sure I was covered in terms of an outfit for that day, loading them all into the suitcase. Certain meetings required a jacket and tie, so I made sure to bring my suit jacket and several ties. I also included two pairs of dress shoes to go with the more formal outfits. I then set out enough underwear and socks to cover the whole trip and packed those in a separate compartment. I packed my tennis shoes, too, and a pair of casual loafers. I then packed some T-shirts and shorts, as well as my bathing suit. Lastly, I packed all my toiletries like my shaver, my toothbrush, hairbrush, and medications. I was all set for my trip and only needed one suitcase to do it.
193	making fresh orange juice	Once upon a time, it was time for a little girl to eat her breakfast before going to school.  It doesn't really matter what the little girl's name was, but we'll call her Jenny.  The first thing Jenny needed to do to get her breakfast ready was to make orange juice.  Jenny didn't want to go to school, much less make orange juice, so Jenny told her mommy that she had forgotten how to make orange juice.  Jenny's mommy -- we'll call her Mommy -- was not stupid and did not believe Jenny but Mommy decided that this would be a great learning opportunity for both of them so she went along with it.  Mommy took an orange that she had bought at the market just the day before.  Mommy took a sharp knife and very carefully cut the orange into two equal halves.  Then, she gently removed the orange peels from each half.  After that, she opened the electric juicer sitting on the kitchen counter and tossed in both halves of the orange before closing the lid and starting the juicer.  Seconds later, fresh orange juice poured into the little jar at the bottom of the device.  When the machine was finished, Mommy handed the jar to Jenny and said, "Crisis averted.  Go upstairs and get ready for school."  Jenny pouted but drank the fresh orange juice before sullenly going upstairs to get ready for another day of learning.  Jenny was seventeen years old.
194	borrowing a book from the library	I waited too long to start working on my report that was due for my class . I was in a hurry , and had to get some research material for the assignment . Sadly , one of the requirements for this report was to have a couple citations from a book instead of other articles that can easily be found on the internet . After an hour of searching for my library card , I found it at last and head out . After I arrived I had to ask the librarian where they kept such books . It was a while since I have been in there . After finding the section . I carefully looked through the books that caught my eye and picked the book that I needed for my report . I walked up to the librarian , and borrowed the book . But not without paying an old book fee I had from a year ago . After I paid , I walked out with the book in hand ready to do some research . 
195	sending party invitations	I was having a birthday party and wanted to invite all my family and friends so I had to make invitations. I went to the store to pick out the prettiest invitations I could find. There was so many to chose from I had to narrow down my choice. After I picked out my favorite it was time to fill them out. When I got home I got the list I made of people to invite so I did not forget anyone. I got out my address book and found everyone's address to put on the envelope . After they were collected and wrote down on the invites it was time to get stamps. I got them out of the desk and began filling out the envelopes. After the envelopes were done I put the invitations in them, sealed the envelope, and put a stamp on the right corner.  I mailed out all the invitations and was excited for the party to come.
196	making tea	After a long day, I decided that I wanted to make some tea to sit on. I began by getting a boiling pot out of the pantry, and filling it with water from the sink. I placed the pot with water on the stove, and turned the heat on to high. While I allow the water to heat to boiling on the stove, I removed a teabag from the box, unwrapping it's from the foil and preparing it for use. I then selected my cup that I wish to drink my tea from, and placed the prepared teabag inside of the cup. After about five minutes, the water had begun to boil, so I removed the pots from the stove and poured hot water into my cup. I filled the cup with water, allowing the teabag to be submerged in the hot water, and watched as the teabag turned the water into a brownish color. I placed the pots back on the stove, and turned the heat completely off. I then grabbed my cup with one hand, and the papers them of the teabag and began to dock the teabag in a up and down motion while in the water. This encouraged the water to turn darker as more of the flavor and aroma from the teabag became dissolved into the hot water. After performing the up-and-down motion for about a minute, I placed the cup on the table, allowing the bag to sit in the water a little longer, and allow the water to cool off. After about five minutes, I took the teabag out of the water, and put in a spoonful of sugar to sweeten the tea, then I stirred the tea and sugar so that I may begin to drink the tea.
197	making coffee	It is morning and I just woke up. I am very sleepy and think that some coffee will wake me up. Coffee has caffeine in it, which is good at waking people up and giving them energy. Too much caffeine is bad though and can make you feel nervous. I make sure to only drink coffee every now and then to stay healthy. Coffee is made from pouring hot water on coffee beans, and a coffee maker does this for you. I make sure that the coffee maker has enough water in it, and put coffee beans that have been smashed up into the top. The coffee is easier to make when the beans are smashed up, so people normally smash the beans into grounds. I turn the coffee maker on, and it heats up the water and pours it into the coffee grounds. The water passes through the machine and falls out as coffee into a cup I put at the bottom. My coffee is hot and ready, and smells good.
198	repairing a bicycle	Some years ago , I used my bike to get around town a lot . Of course , came the time when you have to make repairs . I found out a lot about bicycle tires during this time . My tire had a leak so I bought a repair kit . I had no idea how to use it but I did find out . I had to take the whole wheel off the bicycle . Next I pried the tires from the rim and that took some doing . Okay once I got that off I had to take the inner tube out also and I learned that I had to be very careful with the inner tube because I could cause more damage by being rough . Next , I took the inner tube to the gas station to get air since I did n't have a manual air pump . I learned really quickly that I needed to fill the inner tube with care or I would be buying another one since the air fills it quickly and the tube can pop . Once I put a little air in the tube I had to listen as I pressed the air out to determine where the leak was actually at . Once the leak location was identified then I was able to take the tube home and use the glue from the kit and apply the rubber patch . Of course I had to allow the tube to dry and then deflate it to get it back on the bicycle . Once I got it all put back together I walked my bike back to the gas station for air . 
199	preparing dinner	Yesterday it was Sunday. We had guests at our house. I had to prepare dinner for them. So I woke up early in the morning. Then I decided what dish I am going to prepare. I wrote down all the ingredients needed for that dish. Then I checked the list to make sure I have all the ingredients. I took out the pen from the closet. I put the pen on the stove. I arranged all the ingredients needed on the shelf while pen was heating up. Then I add some oil in pen and added ingredients of the dish I was preparing. I stirred all the ingredients thoroughly. After the food item was prepared I transfer it from the pen to dinner vessel. then I took that vessel and put it on table. I put dinner mats on table. Everything seemed prepared for dinner, and I was then just waiting for guests to arrive.
200	washing clothes	I just got back from a vacation spending a week at the beach with my son. It was so nice to get away for a while. What is not nice is the amount of laundry I now have to do! The first thing I did was take both of our suitcases down the hall to the laundry room. I dumped out all of our dirty clothes. I sorted into 3 piles- the towels and thick items that don't have any wash restrictions. The second pile was my clothes, which many need to be hung up, but I like to use a strong smelling detergent. The third pile consisted of all of my son's clothes, as well as any delicate items, such as bathing suits that will be washed in a free and clear detergent, as my son has skin allergies. I placed one load into the washing machine, with the appropriate detergent. When it was done, I put the clothes in the dryer or hung those that cannot dry. I added a dryer sheet and started the process over with the next batch. It take time, but sorting it out is the best way to tackle the task.
201	chopping vegetables	First what i like to do is pick a straight edge knife and sharpen the knife then rinse it and wipe it off to remove loose metal particles. I set the knife on the counter next to the sink and grab my favorite bamboo cutting board and set that on the counter next to the knife. I walk over to the fridge and open the crisper drawer and pull out whatever vegetable I feel like eating; usually a carrot, cucumber or tomato. I rinse the produce off and set it on my bamboo cutting board. I pick up the knife (preferably a santoku) and begin slicing by pushing down and forward and then pulling back while still pressing down. The knife should be held in somewhat of a fist without any fingers extended. I push each slice away from the main piece each time. Once I am down I pick up the cutting board and use the knife to slide the vegetable slices into a dish.
202	making a dinner reservation	So last night, Chris and I decided we wanted to eat out and we wanted Korean this Friday. We immediately logged on the computer and did a search for Korean barbecue. The search engine pulled-up several restaurants including One Table which makes online reservations. There were several listing on the site, so we chose one nearby and had received rave reviews on another site. The restaurant is called Takorea and it's about four miles away. There was link to make our dinner reservations on the site. Great. That makes it very convenient. On the site, you had to first select your restaurant, of course. Then it requested and date, party number and time. There were several options to choose from for time so taking into consideration of traffic and parking, we made our reservation for the two of us on Friday, June 2, at 7:30 pm. The site requested we show up a few minutes early in case the table opens up sooner. I'm really looking forward to going tomorrow.
203	making a dinner reservation	I got promoted at my job, and I wanted to invite my close relatives. I do at home all the time, and i wanted something different this time. I decided this time I will make reservation at dinner, so I will be free of worries to cook and mass. I was very happy with my decision. So I called around for nice restaurants. I was particularly looking for some nice sea food, so that why I narrowed down my list to 3. Then I looked for review of the restaurants, and I found one restaurant called" little island". I went through the menu items, and I Liked all the items that was on buffet that evening.  They recommended lunch buffet for more varieties.  So I decided to go with lunch buffet.  I made reservation for 40 people, between 12pm to 3 pm. They gave me some discount as I told them to use recycled material, and I participated in their volunteering program.
204	renovating a room	I wanted to redo my master bathroom.  The bathroom was old and not up to date.  I looked at a bunch of magazines and different bathrooms to get inspiration on how I wanted my newly renovated bathroom to look.  I decided to do marble counters and ceramic floor tiles.  I also decided to redo the shower with a frameless glass shower door and chrome fixtures.  I then asked friends and family for referrals on contractors.  I contacted three different contractors that my friends referred to me as reliable and got some bids.  The bids were very close in price but different in when they could start and finish.  I picked the person who I thought gave me a realistic time frame on when the work could be done.  The work started and the contractor demolished the existing bathroom but then took over a week to come back and renovate the bathroom.  It took longer than I thought it would but the end result is great.  I love my new bathroom.  It is exactly the way I want it to be.
205	making a flight reservation	A few weeks ago I had to go visit my family in Wisconsin. Since I live in New York, it is quite a long way to drive, so I had to buy a plane ticket. It is much easier to do so today using the Internet, so I went online and searched for flights from New York to Wisconsin. There are so many flights each day, so it was important to pick one at a good date and time without too long of a layover or stop anywhere. I found a flight that was at a good time, and only had a short stop in Chicago each direction, so I booked that ticket. I was able to choose my seat and pay online, I got a confirmation number and was ready to go. I made sure to get to the airport early enough so that I could print my boarding passes, check my luggage, and get through security. After that I was good to go, and off to see my family.
206	making a flight reservation	I needed to fly across the country to visit my sick aunt, which meant I needed to take an airplane. In order to get my airplane ticket I had to make a reservation. I did this using my computer. First, I logged onto the website of the airline. Next, I typed in the information about where I needed to go and what day I needed to be there, as well as how long I would be there and what day I would be returning home. The website took all of this information and gave me a price. It was a fair price, so I clicked the "accept" button and entered my credit card information into the form on the website. The website processed the information and gave me a ticket number which I then printed out to take with me to the airport. Finally, I closed the website and turned off my computer so I could start packing for the trip.
207	visiting a museum	Last week I went to an art museum.  I got there early in the day so that I would have lots of time to look at everything.  The museum had many kinds of art.  There were paintings and drawings.  There were ceramics.  There were sculptures.  I went to see the paintings first.  There were some paintings by famous artists.  Other paintings were by artists I had never heard of.  I enjoyed the paintings of still life, such as flowers and fruit.  Next I went to see the ceramics display.  Some of the pottery was over 1,000 years old.  The designs on the pottery were detailed and very pretty.  Some of the pieces were brightly colored and others were brown and beige.  Some of the pottery was damaged and pieces were missing. There was some Chinese pottery and it had colorful dragons painted on it.   I enjoyed looking at all of the different styles and designs.  Finally I went to see the sculptures.  I liked the sculptures of horses.  There was a sculpture of a man riding on a horse that I particularly liked.  The man was an Indian and was wearing only pants and a feather in his hair.  He had a fierce expression on his face. It was easy to imagine him riding into battle on his horse.  After visiting the exhibits in the museum for several hours I was tired, so I got in my car and drove home.
208	going grocery shopping	Before I go grocery shopping I make a list . I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . I do n't like to jump lines if one line seems to be moving faster . Good to have a little bit of patience . I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags . 
209	taking the underground	I live about an hour outside of the city limits in a quiet, small suburb outside the city. There is an underground rail line that runs from nearby my house and takes me directly to the city where I work. My train typically leaves at 6:43 a.m. so I am sure to arrive at the station at 6:30. I wait amongst all the other people who commute to work and eat some breakfast I had prepared for myself the night before. Once the train arrives, people shuffle on board and find themselves either a bench to sit in, or space in which to stand. The ride takes about an hour with a couple of stops along the way. During the trip, if I am lucky to find a bench, I bring my laptop out and begin my work for the day. If I must stand I typically try to strike up conversation with my neighbor.
210	cleaning up a flat	My wife and I invited some friends over to our flat to watch a television show we all like.  We needed to make the flat clean so that our friends would be comfortable when they came over.  My wife decided to pick up all of the things that were on the floor.  She then passed a vacuum over all of the floor to make sure that they were nice and clean.  I wanted to clean the bathroom, so I went in there with glass cleaner and toilet bowel cleaner to make sure that it was very clean.  I poured the toilet bowel cleaner into the porcelain toilet and scrubbed the inside and outside to ensure that it was clean.  The kitchen was then cleaned by my wife with a rag and a good cleaner.  We straightened up the pillows on the couch as a little finishing touch to our work.
211	getting the newspaper	Yesterday I decided I wanted to get a newspaper so I could look at the print ads for Father's Day gift ideas. Unfortunately, I had a problem. I don't have a newspaper delivery at home, because I live in a rural area and the newspaper delivery doesn't come to where I live. I decided to get a newspaper, so I drove to the grocery store, where there is a newspaper box that has the daily paper. I went to the newspaper box and realized I didn't have any change; papers from the paper box cost fifty cents. I went into the grocery store and bought some groceries, and when I was paying for my groceries I asked the cashier to give me a dollar's worth of quarters in with my change. I went back outside to the paper box and put two quarters into the box to get my paper. I took the newspaper and drove home to look at the advertisements.
212	flying in a plane	I was planning a relaxing vacation at the beach . There was only one problem : I did n't live anywhere near a beach ! Driving to one in a car would take up too much of my fun vacation time . I had to buy tickets for an airplane ride , which would take much less time because airplanes go very fast . I went to the website of my local airport and found the available planes traveling to the city where I wanted to go at the time I was going on vacation and bought a ticket . The planes were ready to fly only at certain times . When it came time to go on my trip , I packed up my suitcases , drove to the airport before my plane was ready to fly , and parked my car . Inside the airport , I had to go through a long line for security , so that they can make sure there are no dangerous items being taken on the plane . The workers looked inside my suitcases with an X-Ray machine and checked the clothing I was wearing to make sure I was safe , too . When I was all done in security , I had to find the gate for my plane , where it would be ready to pick me and other passengers up . When it was time to board the plane , the stewardess helped me find my assigned seat and put my suitcase in the compartment above me . I buckled my seat belt and waited for the plane to take off . When all the passengers were on board , the stewardess explained what to do in an emergency , and the plane began to move . It became very noisy and all of a sudden , outside the window , I could see the ground get farther away . I felt like my body was being pushed against my seat a little bit . After a few minutes , the plane stopped going up and the stewardess told us we could take our seat belts off . She offered us drinks from a cart , and I was able to read a book I brought on the plane . I knew the ride would last a fair amount of time , so I made sure I had something to do . After a few hours , the captain explained on the intercom that we were arriving in the city . He told us to buckle our seat belts again , and the plane gently came closer to the ground . Finally , I felt a bump as the plane arrived at the airport in the new city . My plane ride was over , and my beach vacation was beginning . 
213	having a barbecue	I decided to have some friends over for a barbecue. I was going to invite about 15 people so I decided that I needed to purchase about 8 to 10 pounds of meat. I bought chicken legs and pork ribs at the grocery store. I knew that a few people that would be coming do not eat meat so I made sure to have plenty of options. I made baked beans, cole slaw and grilled corn. I also made a Mexican salad that had corn, beans and some tortilla chips in it. There were going to be about 5 children there so I made sure to have games for them to play and I even bought some balloons for a water balloon toss. I told people to bring their bathing suits as well so they could swim. I turned out to be a fun day and everyone really enjoyed themselves.
214	washing dishes	My dishwasher is broken so today I had to wash all of my dishes by hand.  After dinner I put all of the dirty dishes into the sink.  I added a generous amount of soap and I let the dishes soak for about a half an hour.  After the dishes had soaked I picked up my dish scrubber and began washing all the dishes, glasses and silverware one by one.  Once each piece was clean I put them into a drying rack until I finished all of the dishes.  Once I had completed washing all of the dishes I went to the pantry and picked up a clean dishtowel for drying the dishes.  I dried each dish, glass, and every piece of silverware and put them back in the drying rack.  Once every piece was dry I put all of the dishes away in the proper cabinets in my kitchen.
215	making a dinner reservation	The last time that I made a dinner reservation, it was to a nice restaurant in town that was always busy. With the expectation that it would be busy on a Saturday night, I made the reservation in advance and when I came to the restaurant I received my seat quickly. On the phone, I had to give the time, as well as my name and amount of people in my party. Upon arriving at the restaurant, there was already a seat ready and we got seated quickly. Many people were waiting outside and I was so thankful that I made a reservation. I called and made the reservation, but I also realized that if I was interested, I could have made  the reservation online and it would have showed me my place in line. This was a good experience and I felt like I saved a lot of time that I would have spend waiting for a table.
216	going to the sauna	Today, me and my friends decided  to take a trip to the spa. We wanted to relax in the sauna, so we got changed into our swimsuits and went into the small room. We spread out on the long benches beside the pit with burning hot rocks. We all took turns spooning water out of the bucket onto the stones to get the steam flowing; we let the heat wash over us, open up our pores and seep into our muscles. It was fun sitting with my friends enjoying the steam, I even stretched out on the bench and it made the whole experience even better. After an hour of soaking up the hot vapors we decided it was long enough; so we gathered our towels and went to cool off with a cold shower. It was a great way to spend a day and I can't wait to do it again.
217	making a bed	I woke up this morning alert and ready.  Before doing anything else, I knew I had to make my bed.  My mother hates when my bed is a mess.  I think it looks tidier when it's made too!  I threw all the pillows off of my bed onto the floor to get them out of the way.  Then I took the sheet and pulled it up to the head of the bed.  I walked around to the other side, making sure it was all even.  After the sheets were fixed, I did the same thing with the comforter.  I made sure everything was nice and wrinkle free.  That's when I put the pillows back on the bed.  I arranged them neatly, one on top of the other.  The open part of the pillowcase was put facing the wall, because that looks cleaner to me.  After that I was done and went to get my clothes.
218	making omelette	I had a craving for eggs the other morning, so I decided to make an omelette.  First, I got out 2 eggs and cracked them into a bowl.  I sprinkled a little salt and pepper into the eggs.  Next, I sprayed a small frying pan with cooking spray and started it heating on the stove while I beat the eggs with a whisk.  When the pan was hot, I turned down the heat and poured in my eggs.  I lifted the pan slightly and swirled the eggs around until they covered the bottom, then I set the pan down and let the eggs cook slowly.  While they cooked, I got out some cheese, ham, chopped onion, and chopped green peppers.  When the eggs looked fairly well set on top, I placed the cheese, ham, and vegetables on top.  Then, with a spatula, I carefully folded the omelette in half covering the fillings.  I put a lid on the pan and let it heat a little longer until the cheese was melted.  Then I ate my omelette!
219	taking a taxi	I wake up at about noon. I can't believe I missed my alarm clock again. I need to be at my sister's office in 20 minutes. Put on clothes as fast as I can and run outside and call an uber. An uber driver was fortunately just a few blocks away and snags me, so it appears that things are going well so far. I get into his car and am sweating and visibly stresses. The cab driver, a man named Marcus, asks how I am doing in a very down to Earth way. I let him know I am fine and was just in a rush. As I finish my sentence I hear a man on his radio say "You just got to relax." Marcus was playing some peaceful reggae music, and just hearing that line was enough for me to do that. I relaxed, and was soon at my destination a couple minutes early
220	shopping online	I need to get Audrey a birthday present and I don't really have time to go to the store and look for something. Plus I need to factor in time to ship it to her in Austin. I decide I'm going to shop online and find something special for her. I want to get her this special sketchbook since I know she likes to draw. I do a search online and find several options. I check them on decide on the website which offers the best deal on the sketchbook with free shipping. They will also gift wrap and send a message in my package. I select the item and head to the cart by selecting the shopping cart icon. There I am directed to fill out all my personal and billing information, destination information and finally my note to Audrey. The website takes me to a review page and I check all the information one more time before submitting my order. That's it I'm done.
221	feeding an infant	Over the last year, it happened on several occasions where an aunt of mine wasn't able to secure a babysitter for her month old son, so she would ask me if I was willing to watch him while she went to work. Seeing it as a good opportunity to gain some experience in caring for a baby, I would accept. Turns out that it was not that easy. My baby cousin is awfully loud and cries a lot. Thankfully, my aunt told me of a trick that works to calm him down and get him to nap. Also going off of what she told me, I would feed him at specific times. However, he liked to make a mess with the baby food, so it was a bit of a hassle. Then there were the times I needed to change his diaper. With my mom's help, I was able to clean him up good and put on a new diaper.
222	having a barbecue	Katie and Jesse from next door came over and left an invitation to have a barbecue pitch in at their house. As, we packed the kids up, I made some potato salad while I waited for them to fight and argue, and finally put their shoes and jackets on so we could leave. "Kevin,: I yelled as I got to the front door, "Don't forget to bring the big cooler over in the car when you get up and around. My husband Kevin had just had surgery on his back, and it took him a lot longer to get up and around. He definitely couldn't make the quarter of a mile trek down to Katie and Jesse's. Though, I was pretty sure he liked going to the parties the neighbors threw even more that the kids did. "I called over to Katie, and she said that they have all the meat there already, so no need for you to drag yourself off to the grocery. Just rest, and I'll see you there. I love you. I'll save you a cheeseburger," I teased as I kissed him goodbye. He grinned at me and beeped my nose, "I love you Sally Jean,: He said with an exaggerated southern drawl. He then turned and gave our four young boys the evil eye, "I expect you to be good and eat lots of hamburgers and hot dogs at the barbecue." They all nodded in unison and screamed, "Hamburgers!" like wild Indians. I love going to eat others peoples food, and let my kids make a mess somewhere that I don't have to clean it up.
223	cleaning up toys	To clean up toys, I would first make sure that I have all of the different packages or boxes that the toys came from. I would collect all of the toys that are on the floor and sort them into different piles. For example, I would put all of the Legos in one pile, dolls in one pile, toy cars in one pile, and games in one pile. I would then put the Legos into the box or container that they came in. I would do the same with the other toys and then I would gather all the the toys that I had put back in their original boxes and I would put then into one big toy box. There might be a few toys that I would not put away, like a special doll that my child might want to have with her throughout the day or take to bed with her at night.
224	shopping online	When I was getting ready to have a job, I wanted to have my face look good so I went shopping online for a shaver.  I opened up my computer and looked up where to buy a good shaver for my face.  In the page I looked at, I found that I could buy them from a lot of different places.  I picked the one that looked really good to me.  I looked at how much it would cost and how long it would take to get to my house.  When I decided on a shaver, I decided that I would pay for it now and have it come to my house.  I put in my information to pay for the shaver and they told me they would send it to me in the mail.  After about a couple of days, the shaver came to my house in the mail.
225	making a hot dog	This past Monday, my family had a small party at my house. One of the main foods that we had to eat were hot dogs. My cousins were the ones who had the idea to eat hot dogs, so they took them over to the house to make. My dad was using our barbecue grill to do all of the cooking, so that's how he cooked the hot dogs. After letting them cook for the amount of time that they needed to, my dad gave the cooked hot dogs to my aunt to prepare them. She put each individual hot dog in a bun and added ketchup, mustard, cheese, and onions. For anyone that wanted it, she also added some of her homemade chili instead of the ketchup and mustard. Everyone at the party seemed to really enjoy the hot dogs, and so did I. Now we know to have hot dogs at any parties we do next time.
226	taking the underground	Last week when I took a trip into the city I had to ride on the underground to get from one place to another. There are stations all around the city, so I had to find the one that was closest to my destination so I wouldn't have to walk too far after I got off. When I got to the station, I walked down the stairs that led into the underground and went over to the kiosk so I could pay my fee. After I paid my fee I took the ticket and went through the turnstile towards the train. I had to wait with a group of people for the train to arrive, but it didn't take very long. When the train got to my station the doors slowly slid open and everyone walked inside. We found our seats and waited patiently for the train to start moving. I didn't take long. Soon, a nice voice came over the intercom announcing my destination was the next stop, so I stood up and waited to exit the train.
227	flying in a plane	My sons and I were invited by their grandmother to come for a visit . We decided to fly across the country . We went to the airport and purchased plane tickets .

Then we sat back and flew all the way to Reno , NV where we were picked up from the airport by grandma . 
228	cleaning up toys	I love to play with my friends, and we play with all sorts of fun and cool toys and games.  When my friends and I are finished playing, we know it is time to clean up our toys.  We all work together to help, and put all the toys back in their boxes, and then we put the boxes away on the proper shelves.  It is important to take good care of our belongings, so we can play with them again another day.  It is important to make sure all the pieces are found, and put back in the right boxes.  It is no fun when someone wants to do a puzzle, and there are pieces missing, or when we want to play a game, but the cards or dice are not in the box!  Taking care of our things, and tidying up after we finish using them, shows that we care about our belongings.

230	playing tennis	One day Courtney was going to the tennis court to play a friendly game with her best friend Vivian. When they got there they got out their tennis balls and tennis rackets, they performed a simple warm up routine by hitting the ball back and fourth. Then the competition really had started to begin Vivian tossed an overhand throw towards Courtney. That really made Courtney mad so she decided it was time to pull out a secret move that she had been working on called: The Mega sword death punch as soon as Courtney had performed that moved on Vivian she could feel the heat coming at her and he knew that she had to get out out of the way of the ball. when Vivian opened her eyes, she could see the ball and her entire side of the tennis court up in flames! Vivian thought it was best for her to go home and wait for Courtney to call her from there. Courtney was left to clean up the mess, but she didn't think twice. She called an uber and went home. She went straight to bed and dint call Vivian again.
231	taking a shower	Sheila walked in the front door of her home. She was all dirty. Sheila said,"I'm going to take a shower now." when Sheila opened the bathroom door she took her clothes off and put them in the hamper. Then she unlocked her iPhone and started to play her "shower" playlist. The playlist had songs like, Witness by Katy Perry, and One dance by drake. When the music started playing Sheila opened the shower curtains and turned on the water. She waited for the water to heat up. Once the water was warm enough for Sheila to take her shower she jumped in and closed the curtains. she sang along to her music and washed her body. Then Sheila was done with her shower, she walked over to the closet and grabbed a towel to dry off with. When Sheila was done. she tooter her iPhone and stopped the music. then she went to her room and got ready for bed.
232	making toasted bread	When I woke up this morning, I really wanted to eat some toast.  I walked into my kitchen and made sure that my toaster was plugged into the wall.  Then, I got out a loaf of bread and took out two pieces.  I put each piece into one half of the toaster in the little slots.  I didn't want my bread to be too burnt, so I turned down the setting so it wasn't going to be in the toaster for so long.  I pushed the lever down and the bread started to cook in the toaster.  While it was cooking, I got out some butter and a knife so I could put that on the toast.  When the toast was finished, the pieces popped outside of the toaster, ready to pull out.  I pulled them out and put them on a plate and put butter on both of the pieces.
233	going on a date	I started talking to this girl on Facebook, she was part of a meme group I belonged to. I found out that she lived in the same state as me only an hours drive away. We had a lot in common and she was definitely flirting with me and I flirted back. I eventually worked up the courage to ask her on a date,  I don't know why I was so nervous (I knew she'd say yes.) I asked what kind of food she liked and she said sushi or Chinese. I was happy because that is also my favorite type of food. we set the date for the following Wednesday, we chose Wednesday because restaurants tend to be less crowded on a Wednesday after noon, and she has social anxiety. Wednesday came and I got up early and did my daily routine. I showered and dressed in my best casual yet classy clothing, put on my favorite cologne and made sure I had my phone, keys and wallet with cards inside. I called her to let her know I was on my way and would be there around 11 a.m. She was super happy sounding and said she'd be ready. I arrived and knocked on the door and was greeted by her in a beautiful and elegant sundress that made her bright green eyes and auburn hair pop. She was amazing. At the restaurant we were both very quiet, but smiled a lot at each other while stuffing out faces with freshly made sushi and egg rolls. I paid for us both and she offered to leave the tip.
234	changing a baby diaper	The baby was in the crib and started to cry. She was crying a lot.   I had just fed the baby, so I didn't know what was wrong.  Why would she be crying?  Then, by the smell, I realized that the baby needed a diaper change.  So I went to the baby, and I slowly took the baby to the changing table. I lied the baby down and took off the baby's pants and took off the old diaper.  Then I got a wipe, and wiped the baby, making sure it was clean.  I then got the powder, and powdered the baby's butt.  After that, I grabbed a diaper from the bag and I put on a fresh clean diaper on the baby.  Then I put on the baby's pants and clothes on and the baby was now happy.  The baby stopped crying and was now finally comfortable.  I then put the baby back in the crib to sleep.
235	throwing a party	It was my one of my roommate's birthdays, and the rest of my friends that I live with and I decided to throw him a surprise party. First, we figured out where my roommate would be while we were decorating our house for the party so that he wouldn't know anything was going on. We decided to decorate everything while he was at work so he wouldn't see. Then, we planned what kinds of activities we wanted to have at the party. We decided to get a pi?ata, some fun water balloon games for our backyard, and of course, a big cake for everyone to share. On the big day, we decorated our house and once my roommate got there, everyone hid in their places to jump out and surprise him. We yelled "surprise!" and my roommate was so shocked! He was really happy that we had thought of him on his birthday and he loved everything we had planned for his party. It was a great day for everyone.
236	visiting a museum	There aren't many inexpensive things to do in Seattle -- and that's especially true if you're a student. Finally, I found something online: a cheap trip to an art museum. I couldn't book online, but I made a note to go in on Sunday. When Sunday came around, I waited in a short line behind a few other people. I paid for my ticket without hassle. Once everyone had their tickets, a guide met us and led the group through the museum. I saw lots of exhibits: paintings, sculptures, pottery, and more. The group eventually split up and I explored the museum on my own. There was so much to see in the museum. Even if I'd stayed all day, there was no way I could have seen all of it. At the end of my trip, I went to the souvenir store and bought myself a few trinkets. It was great!
237	cooking pasta	For dinner tonight I decided to cook pasta. I entered my kitchen and grabbed a pot from under the stove. I filled the pot to the brim with water and placed the pot on the stove. I turned the heat on high so that the water would boil. While I was waiting for the water to boil I entered my pantry and chose the type of pasta I would be making. I had various choices such as spaghetti, penne, angel hair and elbow macaroni. I decided on penne. Approximately twenty minutes after I placed the water to boil on the stove the water was at a rolling boil which is perfect for cooking pasta. I turned the heat down on the stove to medium. I grabbed an empty bowl from my cupboard and filled it with penne pasta so I had one serving. I dumped the bowl of pasta in the water. After doing this I added a pinch of salt because it gives the pasta flavor. I took a wooden spoon and stirred the pasta occasionally. After about fifteen minutes I took my wooden spoon and tried the texture of the pasta to ensure it was filly cooked and tender. It was so I grabbed a strainer under my cupboard and placed it in the sink. I took the pasta off the stove and dumped it into the strainer. I bounced the strainer up and down to make sure there wasn't an excess of water. Once there was no more water I put the pasta into a bowl and chose my sauce. I enjoyed my pasta.
238	having a barbecue	Last weekend I invited a bunch of my friends over to my house for a barbecue that started around 4 in the afternoon. I was going to cook some chicken and steaks that I had for whoever wanted them, but my friends were also going to bring some of their own food to cook as well. My barbecue grill is in my backyard. Before cooking I put several pieces of hickory wood at the bottom of the grill with some small sticks and paper to get the pieces of wood burning. A few minutes after catching fire the flames went out but the wood turned white and stayed really hot. That's when I knew its was time to start cooking the meat. Throughout the day me and my friends would keep putting food on and off the grill for whoever was hungry while everyone else was either hanging around outside or staying inside to stay out of the heat. I had about 15 people at my house and the last people didn't leave until late in the evening. It was my first barbecue of the summer and I can't wait to do it again.
239	taking the underground	My friend and I left our hotel early, about 6:30. The walk took about fifteen minutes to the station. We had to walk down a long flight of stairs down to the station. We took out our automatic payment cards, walked up to the barrier, and swiped them across the electronic reader. The barrier opened to let us in. We walked up to the map that shows how the different train lines run. We confirmed that we would have to change trains halfway there. We looked at the signs to locate the platform we needed, and walked down another flight of steps to catch our train. We waited on the platform at a safe distance until the train came roaring in. After it came to a stop and the other passengers got off, we entered the train. It was mostly empty and we were able to find seats. At the third stop we got off and quickly walked up another flight of steps to locate the platform for the next train. In two minutes our next train arrived and we got on. This train was crowded and we had to stand. Four stops later we arrived at our destination. We left the train and walked towards the exit.  We passed another set of barriers and swiped our cards again, and then took an escalator up out of the underground to the street.
240	washing dishes	When you eat breakfast, lunch or dinner at home you will find afterwards the plate you used is dirty. So we need make the plate new and shiny again so someone else can use it and it is clean. We take our plate to the sink. We need to fill one side of the sink with warm water. We then will add a little bit of soap. The soap is a special soap just for washing dishes and is usually right by the sink in a big plastic bottle. We will squeeze the bottle and add two or three drops of soap. After the water is warm and soapy we can take our dirty plate and dip it in the water. We will wet a cloth with the warm water and rub the plate until it is clean. We then will turn the faucet on on the other side of the sink and rinse the plate under clean water. When we are all finished we will take a dry towel and dry the dish until it is no longer wet. We then have a clean dish!
241	setting the dining table	Last night we had some special guests for dinner. I and my brother helped our mother to set the dining table. First we cleaned the table well. Then we spread a clean table cloth and put an attractive flower vase in the middle. We arranged the vase with fresh, beautiful flowers. Now comes the arrangement of plates. We placed dinner plates, small plates and glasses for drinks for each chair count. Then we arranged spoons on the left hand side and forks on the right hand side of the plates. Then we neatly folded dining napkins and kept near each plate. A stand filled with extra spoons and forks was also kept in the middle of the table. A separate stand with tissue papers were also placed. We sprayed mild air freshner under the table so that our guests could get good fragrance during the dinner time. Our dining dining able is perfectly ready for dinner.
242	cleaning up a flat	I was in my house having a rich pasta, I lifted my glass of water, it slipped and fell on the floor, the water spread quickly, I finished my lunch and got up immediately look for a bucket and a mop, Clean the floor, I noticed that the floor of my house was very dirty, I dry the water then look around and start to mop, collected lots of dirt and dust, then put water in the bucket and some disinfectant, with the help Of the mop and a cloth, I began to mop the whole floor, after a few minutes my house was clean and with a pleasant smell of cherry, I applied a little wax to the floor and I was very bright, After a few minutes the wax dry and I use a polisher, I love to see my super shiny floor, makes me very happy, my House was sparkling and super clean.
243	washing clothes	Washing clothes is a frequent activity that used to be done by hand but now can be done using washing machines and dryers. Some people with lots of children wash clothes everyday. To wash clothes you need to gather all the dirty clothes and use a laundry machine. Some people have laundry machines at home and some people need to go to a wash house to use laundry machines. The wash houses have all different size machines and some take coins and other wash houses take cards. To wash the clothes you have to separate by color so that all the white clothes are together and all the colored clothing is together. Also if you have sheets and towels you want to wash those separately. When you find a machine that is the right size for the clothes you need to wash you add the clothes and then follow the directions to see how much laundry soap you add. Some people use liquid laundry soap and some people use powder laundry soap. You can even do a mixture or combination but make sure to use the right amount. After adding the clothes and the soap you pay for the machine and wait 30 minutes to 1 hour for the clothes to wash. After the clothes are washed you still need to put them in a dryer unless they are delicate clothes that are not supposed to go into the dryer because they might shrink. You take the clothes and put them in the dryer but make sure not to put anything that might shrink. For the delicate clothes you hang them to dry. After you put all your clothes into the dryers it is time to fold the laundry! This is important so the laundry will be nice and neat and not wrinkled. If you have long pants or nice shirts you can put them on hangers instead of folding.
244	making breakfast	I woke up early yesterday morning.  I decided to make breakfast for the family.  First I opened the fridge to see what we had.  We had bacon and we had eggs, so I took them out and placed them on the counter.  I took some bread out of the freezer.  I pulled a pan from beneath the oven.  I placed it on the front burner.  I turned the burner on to medium.  I added 8 strips of bacon.  I let the bacon cook on one side, and then I flipped the bacon.  I allowed it to cook on the other side, and then I removed it.  I placed the bacon on paper towels so it would drain.  I then poured some of the bacon grease from the pan into a aluminum can.  I heated the pan back up, and added the eggs.  I let the eggs cook on one side until the whites were no longer runny.  I placed the eggs and bacon and bread on a plate and served it to my wife.
245	changing a baby diaper	My son needed his diaper changed just a few hours ago. I noticed that his diaper had a distinct smell and felt full, so I carried him back to his changing table. I laid out a disposable diaper in his size and baby wipes. I took off his shorts and his dirty diaper, using it to clean up some of the mess from his bottom. I folded it over so that the outside that was clean was underneath him. I then used the wipes to clean up any mess that was leftover on his bottom. Once he was adequately clean, I grabbed a new diaper and slipped the back under his bottom. I made sure to talk to him throughout the entire process, and gave him a rattle to play with so that he was distracted. I pulled the tabs on the sides of his diaper across the front and secured them around his waist. I put his shorts back on, picked him up, and threw away the dirty diaper. He felt much better and was ready to play afterwards.
246	taking a taxi	Yesterday I needed to get across town for a meeting. I stepped outside my apartment and walked to the curb. I signaled to an oncoming yellow taxi that I needed a ride by sticking out my arm and waving. A taxi driver soon stopped there at the curb and picked me up. I opened the back door and climbed into the backseat. After climbing in and shutting the door, I gave him the address to where my meeting was taking place. The taxi driver then drove me to the address I had given him and made some small talk about the weather. When we arrived at my destination, I thanked him, and he told me how much the fare was. I gave him some money, and he gave me change because I gave him more than was needed. I then exited the vehicle and closed the door and headed to my meeting.
247	unloading the dishwasher	On some days, when I'm feeling lazy, I'll load up the dishwasher instead of actually doing the dishes myself. I use whatever dishwashing pods or liquid we have at the house to put inside the dishwasher, and I'll set whichever load to wash depending on how much dirty dishes there are. The actual dishwashing process takes some time, so I'll wait around the house while the machine finishes up. After it's done, I'll open it up and pull both racks of dishes out to dry. Once they're done drying, I'll still go over each of them with a paper towel just to make sure that I got any wet spots left behind. Then, when I knew the dishes were completely dry, I would start to put them away. I'd put the silverware in it's drawer, all the plates, cups, and bowls in their rightful cabinets, and all of the pots and pans in their cabinets.
248	preparing dinner	Five o' clock is here! It is time to make dinner. We get out the lettuce and tomatoes from the little drawer in the fridge. Then we chop them up into little pieces. Mother gets red meat out of the fridge and puts it in the frying pan. Then she sprinkles spices onto the meat and I hear it sizzle. Sometimes I eat a tomato when mother isn't looking. Next we get out the cheese and grate little pieces off of the big block with a metal thing. When the meat is all done we put it into a bowl. Then we get out the taco shells and put them on the table. Once everything is all chopped up, we take it to the table and call my Dad and sister to eat. "It smells great!" my dad says. My sister doesn't like tacos, but I love taco night! Tacos are my favorite dinner.
249	making a hot dog	My sister recently came to visit in New York. Since she loves hot dogs, I decided to treat her to some homemade hot dogs. We went shopping at the  supermarket for the  ingredients. When we got back, it was about noon so we got into the kitchen to prepare the lunch. We had brought some meat , paprika garlic and some celery. After frying the  celery, we mixed it with the paprika and garlic and used it to add flavor to the meat. I stuffed meat into the casings while my sister cut the buns. We then set the sausages to cook in the oven for about thirty minutes. We sat recounting how our mother used to teach us how to cook when we were younger and how she always corrected us when we were wrong. After the sausages were cooked , we put them between the buns. Such a delicious lunch.
250	going to a shopping centre	I planned to go to the shopping centre all week. Finally it was shopping day. I dressed comfortably, made my shopping list and grabbed my purse.  On my walk to the shopping centre  I thought about all the things I would buy. Most of the things on my list were items I needed. A tooth brush, some bread, pencils, socks. I had clipped some coupons and knew I would save a few dollars so that I could get that new game I like. I couldn't wait to see it on the shelf and actually hold it in my hands. I arrived at the shopping centre. It wasn't very busy and I was glad of that. First I did all of my important shopping. And sure enough I had enough money for the game. I rushed to the electronics section and sunk in despair when I saw the shelf was empty. They were sold out of the game I had waited so long to play. The store clerk saw my disappointment and offered me a rain check for when they got more stock in. It would be about 2 weeks' but there was hope. I gathered my things and went home. I marked my calendar for when my next trip to the shopping centre would be... in two weeks. Now all I could do was wait... patiently of course!
251	going on a date	I was getting really nervous.  My best friend had set me up on a blind date.  I got to the restaurant early so that I could see her walk through the door.  My hands were getting sweaty and I anxiously watched as someone else walked in.  Was it her?  The young woman looked at me and smiled.  She walked my way and called out my name.  I smiled back, relieved that the worst part might be over.  At least she looked like a friendly girl.  We ordered food and talked to each other as we ate.  She and I really had a lot in common!  After dinner, I walked her to her apartment and she gave me her phone number and a good night kiss.  I was so happy!  I wondered how I could have ever been worried when this was absolutely the best date I had ever had in my life!
252	taking a photograph	Last week, was my son's birthday, his name is Jamie. I planned a surprise party for him. I put up balloons and made a cake. The quest arrived at noon, many of them brought gifts. I wanted to get pictures of everyone. I got my camera out and asked everyone to gather together for a group photo. They stood very still with smiles on their faces. I brought the camera up to my face, looked through the view hole, and made sure I got everyone in the picture. I pushed the snapshot button and took the pictures. I took a couple of pictures of Jamie when he walked in and everyone yelled surprise. We ate cake and had a good time, then everyone went home. I took the film to the store and they printed out the pictures. I paid for the pictures and left the store. Now, Jamie will always have the pictures of his birthday surprise party.
253	visiting the beach	During the summers off I like to go to the beach on my days off.  I will start early in the morning and pack the car with a cooler with drinks and sandwiches, chairs, towels and an umbrella.  I'll drive to the beach and park as close as I can.  Gathering everything up I'll carry it across the sand till I find a nice spot down by the water.  Then ill set up my chair and umbrella, making sure to drive it deep into the sand so it doesn't blow away.  I'll make sure to put on sunscreen before I settle in my chair to sunbath for a while.  And when I am sweating and hot I'll run into the water and swim around to cool off.  While I dry off I'll have a sandwich and something to drink.  I like to listen to the waves crashing and the seagulls. I'll hang out and sun and swim until late in the afternoon before I go home.  Then Ill have to pack everything up, walk across the hot sand and back to my car.  I'll make sure to knock the sand off all my stuff before packing my car and driving home.
254	packing a suitcase	Ah, tomorrow was the first day of our vacation on the coast. It was time to prepare and get everything together that I would need for the week. I opened up the drawers in my dresser, first pulling out a couple pairs of shorts and one pair of jeans. Then I grabbed some T-shits and one sweatshirt in case it got cold at night. Lastly I got out my socks, underwear, and swim trunks. I got the suitcase out of the closet and unzipped it. In the main compartment I put the pants and shirts I had gotten out. I pressed these down so that everything fit nicely. In the smaller compartment I put the remainder of my clothes. I gathered up my toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush and other necessities from the bathroom and put them in a small zippered bag, I then placed this bag in the suitcase. Then i zipped up the suitcase.
255	ordering a pizza	I'm craving some Hawaiian pizza because pineapple is the best pizza topping and it certainly does belong on pizza. I call up my favorite pizza place which is a general store downtown (I have the number memorized) and let them know I want a large fresh dough Hawaiian pizza with bacon and EXTRA pineapple. The lady on the phone tells me it will be ready in approximately 30 minutes, I thank her and hangup the phone. I make sure to note the time and I leave in about ten minutes even though it only takes seven minutes to drive there. I want to browse the store and buy some chips and soda too. While I'm looking at soda I see my favorite key lime pie flavored soda, it's expensive, but I don't care, because I deserve it. Before the full thirty minutes has passed I see the kitchen staff slide a large pizza box onto the counter clearly labeled "Hawaiian" I make my way to the counter with my chips and soda and proceed to pay the cashier using my debit card. I thank him and he tells me to "have a nice day" I respond with; "I will now!" and "thank you sir" I also turn to the lady who made my pizza and thank her too.
256	planting a tree	When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . The tree grew and became quite large . The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit . 
257	taking a taxi	Nobody takes taxis anymore because of Lyft and Uber. Even though lyft and uber are unregulated and probably bad for the economy, drivers, and passengers, they are just so darn convenient. If you take a cab you have to call the cab company and let them know where you want to be picked up. They then send a driver to you. They're supposed to have credit card machines in the cab but often they don't. This means you need to have cash with you. For the fare as well as a tip. So I call a cab and I ask it to take me to the French Quarter. The cab driver says okay and takes the longest route possible so he gets more money. We make inane small talk as he drives until it gets too awkward and then we sit in silence. When we arrive at the destination I overpay him for the ride.
258	flying in a plane	Flying in an airplane is necessary to travel to far away destinations that are not easily accessible by other modes of transportation . Last summer , I had a girls trip to the Carribean . We had to plan our trip including booking airplane tickets and booking hotels . We booked our airplane tickets online a few months before to get the best fare . We arrive at the airport a few hours beforehand for an international flight . We all pack lightly with one piece of luggage . After waiting at the airport for a while , we boarded our plane . The flight attendants and crew are friendly . We find out seats and try to as comfortable in the cramped seating of a packed flight full of passengers . We try to relax , buckle up for a four hour flight . During the four hour flight , we can sleep on watch TV or listen to music . And the crew will come around with drinks and snacks . After a necessary flight , we arrive at our destination safely .
259	chopping vegetables	I was ready to eat.  I was going to sautee some veggies for dinner.  First, I got the vegetables all together.  I grabbed an onion, a bell pepper, some celery and some carrots.  I brought all the veggies to the cutting board on the counter.  I walked over and grabbed my sharpest knife out of the drawer.  I went back to the cutting board and held the onion to the board.  I cut the top and bottom off of the onion and sliced the skin off.  Then I threw those away.  After that, I took the onion and cut it in half.  I started to chop the onion into pieces.  I did the same with the bell pepper.  The carrots and celery were much easier.  I only had to chop little chunks off the ends as I slid the vegetable down the board.  Once all of them were chopped, I threw them in the pot.
260	packing a suitcase	We are going on a vacation, and I will need to pack some clothes and any other things I will need. I went to the garage, where we keep the suitcases. I picked out one that was the right size for the trip I will take. Not too big, but not too small. Once I had it I brought it back to my room. I needed to bring the right clothes for the weather as well as the activities I would do. I also needed to pack things I need if the weather changes. I folded up several sweaters, as small as I could, as well as a few pairs of pants. I folded my tee shirts and paired my socks. Once I had it all folded and ready, I placed the clothes in the suitcase. I doubled check to make sure it would all fit well. I also packed my tooth and hairbrush on the outside pockets.
261	feeding the fish	My friend Thomas was going out of town and asked if I could feed his fish. I said I would of course. Getting into his building was more the challenge. I had to sign in with the front desk, designate my parking place and give my license plate before the door man would let me in the building. I cross the lobby and head upstairs. As I enter the apartment, I see the fish tank. They look happy and very active. The sun is shining in through a window across the room and there is a table next to the tank with a container of fish food. I read the container to make sure I understand the instruction. Thomas said to give the fish two nice size pinches of food. You can't give them too much or it will sink and make the water murky. I try to get just the right amount. The fish get really active when they notice food and immediately start eating. Fish are so easy.
262	cleaning up toys	When I arrived home from school, my mother told me that the living room was very messy and had many toys on the floor.  Even though my brother made some of the mess, I decided to pick up the toys because I like to feel helpful and I know my mom likes it when the house looks good.  I walked around the room, picking up toys. I tried to pick up a couple similar ones at a time, because I would have to put them in the same place.  I picked up all the LEGO pieces off the floor.  I had started building a spaceship but had not had time to finish.  I put all the pieces together in a bag so that they would be together when I wanted to finish building the spaceship.  I put my brother's action figures back up on the shelf where they belonged.  My mom said I could have a popsicle for doing a good job.
263	changing batteries in an alarm clock	I noticed that my alarm clock was not working. The numbers were not showing up on the screen. So I knew it was time to change the batteries. First, I checked to see what kind of batteries it used. It uses one 9 volt battery. Next, I checked to see if I had any 9 volt batteries in the house. I did not, so I knew I had to go to the store. I walked to the store and bought a pack of 9 volt batteries, and returned home. Then, I went to the alarm clock and opened the battery compartment. I took out the old battery and threw it away. Then I took a new battery out of the pack I just bought. I put it in the battery compartment and closed the compartment. Then I checked to see if the numbers were lit up. Then it was time to set the time. I checked my watch for the correct time and pushed the buttons to make the alarm clock the right time. Finally, I set the alarm time to the time I usually wake up and set the alarm for the next day.
264	taking a shower	Before I go to bed at night I like to take a shower.  I will go in and turn on the hot water and while its heating up I will put down a bathmat outside the tub and get my towels.  I will use my hand to check the temperature, and turn on the cold water and to keep the water from getting to hot.  Once its a good temperature I take off my clothes and get in.  I stick my head under the water and get my hair wet and then wash it first with shampoo and then I use the conditioner.  Once I rinse the conditioner out, I was my face with a special face wash.  I like ones that smell like coconut.  I also use a coconut soap for my body and I wash myself down to my toes.  I'll then stand under the water for a few minutes till all the soap has rinsed out, and also cause it feels good.  I keep a waterproof clock in my shower so I don't waste to much hot water standing there for too long so I'll get out after 10 minutes.  I'll stand in the shower and towel off and go get ready for bed.
265	going to the theater	Last night, me and my boyfriend decided that we wanted to go see Superman at the B&B theater. When we arrived, we noticed that there were so many cars in the parking lot and there was a long line at the door to purchase movie tickets. After driving around for 5 minutes, we finally found a parking spot right. When we got to the line, we waited another 10 minutes to get our tickets. Since the Superman movie was in 3D we had to pay extra for our movie tickets. As we were walking to hand in our tickets to the ticket taker, he handed us our 3D glasses to use during the show. Before we walked into our theater, we ordered popcorn, a box of candy, and a large Pepsi. We had to sit in the front row since it was so crowded. After the movie was over, we threw away our 3D glasses into the recycle bin and headed home.
266	making tea	One afternoon I was feeling thirsty and decided to make myself a pot of tea. I grabbed my tea kettle and dumped out all the water that was sitting in there and replaced it with fresh cool water. I placed the full kettle on the stove and turned on the burner to the highest setting to boil the water. While the kettle was warming I took out my teas and tea pot. I decided to have green tea that day, and scooped about 5 teaspoons of tea into the pot. Once the kettle was steaming, I turned off the stove and let it cool down a little. I poured the water in the pot and replaced the lid of the pot. When the tea was done steeping, I poured myself a cup into a tea cup that I had warmed up with some of the excess hot water. I poured in some sugar with a spoon and gave it a stir. Then I enjoyed my tea when it was cool enough to drink.
267	feeding an infant	I hear the baby is crying, so he must be ready for a bottle.  Very carefully I put my hands under the baby, being mindful to support his neck  with one hand so his head doesn't wobble around. I hold the baby close to me, wrapping his blanket around him and cradle him in my arms.  I speak softly to the baby, I make sure his formula is not too warm and not too cold before I feed it to him.  I test the liquid on my wrist before giving it to the baby. I put the nipple of the bottle in the baby's mouth, and I ensure I'm holding the bottle at an angle so there isn't lots of air getting in his tummy.  The baby drinks all the formula and then I put him over my shoulder,  I then gently patting his back to get him to burp.
268	papering a room	Upon deciding that a room in the house needs new wallpaper, the family takes a trip to the hardware store. Wallpaper is selected from the designs available. The wallpaper chosen does not need any extra glue because it is the self-sticking kind and they pick this because it is easier to apply. The family heads home and everyone helps in taking down pictures and posters and any other decorations from the wall.  Dad uses water and a scrub brush to remove the old wallpaper. Everyone helps to clean and dry the walls after the old wallpaper is all gone. When the wall is dry it is time to put the new wallpaper up. The back of the new wallpaper has to be wet, but only a little bit. A small amount of water is applied to the back of the paper and then it is time to carefully place the new wallpaper on the wall. Dad uses a step-ladder to reach the high parts of the wall. Mom and dad use scissors to cut some of the paper to fit around electric outlets and windows. After the wallpaper is applied it needs to dry. The family waits for two or three hours then everyone admires the new wallpaper design and puts picture and posters back up on the wall.
269	laying flooring in a room	In our house, we have a guest room that must not have been touched since the 1970's. It is carpeted in tasteless, dirty and old carpet that is begging to be changed. After considering several options, my wife and I decided to rip the carpet up and install some wood laminate flooring. We picked a day on the weekend and invited her father over to help us with the process. First we ripped the old carpeting up and prepared the bare surface to accept the new flooring. We had the flooring ordered and delivered the day previously, so I spent that night measuring and cutting the pieces to size. After the floor was properly prepped, we began laying each piece of laminate one by one. A few spots did not fit quite as planned so it became necessary to cut some pieces shorter than I had initially. Once we finished we took a long break and ordered pizza for dinner.
270	going to a shopping centre	Every week I have to go to the store to get groceries.  First, I take an inventory of the things in my house and make a list of everything I need to make sure to pick up while I'm out.  I then get into my car and drive across town to the store.  I find a parking spot and get out of the car.  I walk into the store and get a grocery cart.  As I walk into the store, I grab a sale flyer and look at the store's sales and specials.  Next, I start going down the aisles at the store, adding things into my cart that are on my list or are on sale and would be appreciated at my house.  After I am done shopping, I get in line to check out.  I wait patiently for my turn.  When it's finally my turn, I check out and pay for my items.  Lastly, I drive home and put away the things I just purchased from the store.
271	playing a movie	I had a long day and I wanted to do something to relax.  It was night time, so I decided to watch a movie.  My cabinet is where I keep all of my movies that I have.  I went over to my cabinet to pick out the perfect movie to watch that night.  I spent ten minutes trying to pick the best DVD to watch that night.  I looked through all of the movies and I finally picked a movie that I liked and went over to the DVD player.  I turned the player on and I also turned the TV on.  I took the movie disc out of the case and placed it into the player.  Then I pushed the movie in.  The menu came up on the TV screen.  I picked to play the full movie, and I started to watch the movie.  I watched the whole movie.
272	paying bills	Throughout the month, my wife and I get bills to pay for things that we buy or use.  A lot of the times, we get a bill to pay rent and to pay for the electricity and gas that we use to use power and keep our house warm.  When we get the bills, we put them in a nice pile to make sure that we don't lose or forget about any of them.  Once or twice a month, we will sit down and make sure that we pay the bills.  Sometimes we use our computers or phones to log into accounts and pay the bills.  The money comes out of our bank account and we always check to make sure that we have enough of it.  We often will talk about what we can do in the next weeks to make sure that we don't have too many bills to pay.
273	going to the swimming pool	Last week my friend and I went to the public swimming pool nearby where we live. It was a beautiful day outside - a sunny 80 degrees with not a cloud in sight. When we arrived we found an empty spot and put our towels down, along with the items we brought for the day which included some snacks, suntan lotion, books, drinks, and a change of clothes. There were many people there, including lots of children with their parents and some adults alone or with friends. Shortly after we arrived, we put on suntan lotion and took a dip in the pool. It was just the right temperature. Cool, but not too cold. We swam around for a bit and then got out and laid on our towels for a while. We relaxed in the sun and had a nice chat about what was going on in our lives while we ate some snacks. I then took out my book and began to read while my friend relaxed with her eyes closed for a while. I eventually became tired of reading and went in a dip in the pool by myself for a bit. After a few hours of swimming and relaxing in the sun, it was starting to get late so we decided to head home. We put some warm clothes on in the changing room and headed home for the day.
274	renting a movie	On Fridays, my friends and I love to go see movies.  Sometimes, we stay inside the house, and rent movies.  One of the places we like to go to has a machine full of movies called Redbox. We go to this store, and use the machine to rent movies.  When you go up to the Redbox machine, you just press "Rent Movies",  and then it shows you movies you may like.  They even have categories you can pick from, like comedy, drama, suspense, and even scary ones.  Usually, my friends and I pick comedy movies when we watch movies together.  So, once you pick a movie, then you press that button for the movie, and it let's you use your bank card to pay for the movie.  The machine records your card information from your bank, so that whenever you bring it back, it will charge you for how many days you kept it.  It is very cheap to use, and very nice.
275	checking in at an airport	My family has always wanted to take a vacation to Las Vegas, but we live too far away to be able to drive there. Because of this, our only choice was to fly there. Once we knew that we were doing this, my parent's booked a flight to Las Vegas online. We got ready for the flight one day before by packing all of our belongings that we would be taking in suitcases. The airport we would be using was just a half hour away from our house, so the drive wasn't long. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to step through the metal detectors and go through security so that the airport knew we didn't have any weapons or anything illegal. After security, we went to get our plane tickets, and waited until our flight was ready for boarding. We then gave up all of our baggage so that it could be put on the plane, and we got on the plane.
276	making omelette	The last time I made an omelette, I was really hungry, but wanted something healthy to eat. It was me and my girlfriend who needed to eat and we both wanted to eat somewhat healthy, while not going out to spend money and get food. As a result, we found eggs in the refrigerator and took out a few for each of us. We then cracked the eggs into a pan, making sure that the outer crust did not end up in the pan. After that, we let the egg stay in the hot pan for around 5 minutes, adding cheese as necessary. As we watched the egg form and stirred it, we started to turn the stove off. Soon after, the omelette was done and we placed it onto a plate with a fork. After this, we began to eat and we enjoyed the amazing cheese filled omelette that we made.
277	ordering a pizza	Last night, I ordered pizza for dinner. Pizza is one of my favorite foods. I had a couple of friends over, so we decided to order two pizzas in order to feed all of us. My friends and I couldn't agree on which toppings we wanted, so we decided to get one pizza that was half cheese, half pepperoni, and another pizza that was half veggie, half sausage. We looked up the phone number to our nearby pizza place by searching the Internet. We then put a call in and spoke with the hostess, who took our order. She said that the pizza would be ready for pickup in about thirty minutes. We asked if the pizza place offered delivery, and she said yes, but there would be an additional $5 charge. We agreed to pay for the delivery. She told us the total for our bill, and we provided our credit card information and then hung up the phone. Thirty minutes later, we picked up the pizza to take back home.
278	going to the swimming pool	When I was little girl, my friends Tommy, Jessie and I loved going to the pool together.  We would ask our parents if could go to the pool at the gym on the same afternoon, so that we could play together.  Usually, that meant that we would go on Saturdays or Sundays, when our parents were home in the afternoons.  Tommy was a great swimmer, and he taught Jessie and I how to swim and do the back stroke, and even the butterfly stroke.  I was the best at floating, and I always would beat Tommy and Jessie at that game.  I could float better than them both!  I would get on my back and float on top of the water very easily. It was fun!  Jessie had a hard time floating, so she used her floats to help her stay up.  Sometimes her mom brought the large floats we could all get on at once.  We loved those!  We would play horse on them, and also try to knock each other off the floats!
279	paying bills	Erica and David like to pay their bills together. They pay most of them during the last week of the month. She takes the bills out of the drawer where they had been put away as they came in. He gets out their checkbooks, and they both sit down at the kitchen table to work. One by one they go through all the bills, checking to see that everything is as it should be. The cable bill and the car insurance are in Erica's name, while the utilities and telephones are in David's name. They each write checks for the bills, and then David writes a check for the rent on their apartment. They check each bill one last time, then seal up the envelopes and put stamps on them. Then they walk together to the mailbox to send off the bills. They always hold hands when they walk back from the mailbox.
280	taking a shower	After I have played outside with my sister and rolled in the dirt, slid down the slide and threw balls at each other, we picked up a lot of dirt and sweat that my sister and I just could not wipe clean. We get in the house and decide who should go to shower first. We go to our rooms and peel off all the sticky and yucky clothes and gather our clean clothes and underwear. My sister goes first. She turns on the faucet and sets the water at a temperature that is not too warm or cool. We both know to step in carefully, get our wash clothes and soap. A fresh shower with shower and water we know will wash away all the grime from our bodies and hair. We made sure we had clean towels to dry off.  Stepping out of the shower and being clean and fresh really feels good after a long day of play.
281	wrapping a gift	Last year, when getting my girlfriend her birthday gift, I felt that rather than putting it into a bag, I should try to wrap it. It was somewhat big so I and needed to purchase a lot of wrapping paper. I went to Target to purchase wrapping paper and then when I came home, I arranged the scissors and tape together so  that I would be ready to complete this task. I then set the gift wrap on the floor and placed by gift around it. Upon doing this, I started to cut the wrap in a manner that fit the gift, leaving some extra. I had a little trouble, but was able to wrap the gift successfully and give the gift. I felt that having extra wrapping paper and the supplies ready and accessible worked to my advantage and helped me complete this task quickly and efficiently. This was a great experience.
282	making a dinner reservation	I had a friend in town from Denver Colorado next weekend and I wanted to plan one dinner out that was really nice.  I was hoping to find a high end seafood restaurant that had availability for us at short notice.  I searched yelp until I found a place that I thought would be absolutely perfect.  The restaurant is called Grill 23.  I thought for sure that they would be booked but I decided to try and book it anyway.  I accessed Open Table on line and submitted my request for Grill 23 at 7:00 on Saturday night.  Unfortunately they were booked so I had to make our reservation for 9:00 instead.  On Saturday my friend and I spent the day touring and shopping around the city.  By the time it was time for our reservation we were very hungry.  We went to Grill 23 and ended up having an amazing dinner.  It was definitely worth the wait.
283	cleaning the floor	When it was time to clean the floor, the first thing I needed to do was sweep the debris and garbage. I use the broom to sweep the floor from one end to the next, piling all of the dust, dirt and other debris on the floor into a pile in the center of the room. I used a dustpan to collect all the debris, placing it on the floor and using the broom to sweep all of the brie onto the surface of the dustpan. I empty the contents of the dustpan into the garbage then placed the broom and dust pan into the corner. I then made a bucket of water that had floor cleaning solution diluted into it in order to make sites. I took my mop from the corner of the room where the room was, and placed the head of the mob into the water, soaking the head of the mop. Once the head of the mop was completely submerged underwater, and soaking wet, I removed the mop from the bucket and squeeze out the excess water. I then use the mop to wipe over the entire floor. I ensure that all of the stains and stuck on dirt that was on the floor have been removed with the mop, and that the floor looks spotless including when I finished. I rinsed off the mop with clean water, to remove the left over grime and dirt, and placed the mop in the corner. I also emptied the dirty mop water from the bucket, and placed the empty bucket in the corner as well. I then left the room so that the floor could completely dry before I stepped on it again.
284	changing a light bulb	I was reading in bed last night and my light bulb blew in my bed side table lamp.  I put my bookmark into my book, and got up out of bed and went to the light switch to turn on the overhead light so I wasn't in the dark anymore.  I keep spare light bulbs in my pantry and found the one with the right wattage to replace the broken one.  Once back at the lamp I made sure to switch it off and unplug in.  I removed the shade and saw I must have had the light bulb in for a long time because it was a little dark on one side.  I twisted the light bulb up and out and held it to my ear and shook it like a maraca.  The broken coils bounced around inside and it sound like a rattle.  I took the new light bulb and screwed it in, making sure not to over tighten it so it was seated perfectly.  I put the lamp shade back on, plugged it back in and flipped its switch.  The lamp worked just like new.  I put the old light bulb in the garbage before heading back to bed to keep reading.
285	going to the sauna	In the morning, I texted my friend and asked if she wanted to come to the sauna with me. She had expressed interest earlier so I thought she'd want to go. We decided to take Ubers from our houses and meet there. When we got there, we realized that neither of us had brought a towel. Luckily, they had towels at the sauna available for a small fee. We each paid for our visit and included a towel in the purchase. Then we entered the sauna. It was very warm and humid, just like we expected. It was very relaxing. We talked a little bit but mostly we just sat in silence and enjoyed the atmosphere. It was a wooden structure that felt very rustic. Eventually we started to get overheated, and my friend suggested we leave. We got up and exited the sauna. We thanked the workers at the front desk for our visit and then we went on with our day.
286	taking the underground	The first step in taking the underground was determining where I  wanted to go. Then, I consulted Google maps on my phone. I opened the app and typed in my destination. I then selected the public transportation tab and pressed the navigate button. The app told me that I should take the red train to my destination. The station was just a couple of blocks away. I walked there and followed the instructions on the app as to which train to get (red train, northbound). I purchased a ticket at the ticket machine using my credit card. I scanned my ticket, then went through the turnstile. I followed the signs to the correct platform and waited a few minutes to for the train to arrive. When it got there, I waited for the people to exit the train before getting on. The app told me to get off after three stops. Once I got off, I followed the signs to the exit.
287	renovating a room	My husband and I decided that while our son was off at college it would be a good time to renovate his room. It still had cartoony race car trim up and the carpet had seen better days. It's always best to start off with a plan so we sat down a talked about how we wanted the room to look. It is still our son's room when he needs to visit from college so it couldn't be entirely out of his taste. A whiteboard was set up and we made notes about what the room could be after our son finally does move out. An office was the winning choice. We packed everything our son left in the room into boxes and stacked those in the living room. Since DIY isn't really part of our skill set, we shopped around for contractors to help us. They stripped the carpet and trim from the empty room. The painter changed the wall to a warm light grey. When the paint had dried we called a contractor in to put down a nice maroon carpet. The furniture was put back into the room. Afterwards we decided to go through the boxes and only put back the things we were sure our son was keeping. Everything else was left in a box and put in the garage so that our son could look through it when he returned and hopefully throw out some of the junky items.
288	making toasted bread	Yesterday when I woke up, I had to do my morning chores that I do every single day. These are my responsibility and I must get them done every day. To begin this process, I made a to-do list for the day. I wrote the items down in order from highest priority to lowest priority. Then I got to work. I fed the animals (one dog and two cats), took out the garbage, did the dishes, and cleaned the cat's litter box. My next step was to start cooking breakfast. I fried the eggs, cooked the bacon, fried the hash browns, and cooked the toast. After my spouse and I ate, I had a few more dishes to do. After finishing up those dishes, I put a load of laundry into the washer. After about an hour or so, the clothes were done washing and they were ready to be put in the dryer. After the clothes were dried and folded, I was officially done with my chores. I could finally relax!
289	writing a letter	I miss one of my friends that lives far away, and think of writing a letter to him. I think about what I would like to talk about. I get out a sheet of paper and pen and begin to write the letter. At the top of the page, I write, "Dear" and then my friend's name to show that this letter is for him. I then write a lot in the middle about things I want to ask him, like how he is doing and if he is happy. I ask about his family and invite him to come stay on vacation sometime. Once I am finished, I skip a few spaces to the bottom and write, "From" and then my name to show that the letter is from me. It's very important to write who the letter is for at the top and who you are at the bottom. If you don't, the person reading the letter might not know who you are, or think this letter is not for them.
290	feeding a cat	When I last fed my cat, I had a couple step process. I first put the food in her bowl and made sure that she had an adequate amount of water. I also made sure the food bowl was clean and that it was not overflowing. I had to find the food that I always give to her and open it up before putting it into the bowl. This was easy and I felt like it was routine. My cat eventually came over and started to eat from the bowl. Once it was finished, I did not give anymore, as I give a measured amount of food each time. After  the cat ate all of the food, I refilled her water bowl and left her food bowl there. I also put the food away in the closet and made sure the seal the bag shut. This is a daily routine.
291	answering the phone	I was walking down the street with my phone in my pocket, when it began to vibrate.  I pulled my phone out of the pocket and looked at the screen.  The screen indicated that I was receiving an incoming phone call from my sister.  I pressed the button on the screen marked "accept" to indicate that I wanted to accept the call.  I then lifted the phone to my ear and said "Hello, Sister!" in a pleasant voice.  My sister was calling to discuss the details of our upcoming family vacation this summer.  I confirmed that I agreed with her hotel selections for our vacation.  We chatted for a while, and then she indicated that she had go to an appointment downtown.  I told her that I was glad to have had a chance to have spoken with her, and that I would speak to her again soon.  I pressed the button to end the call and hung up the phone.
292	preparing dinner	Last night, I cooked dinner at home for my partner and I. One of my favorite dinners to prepare is lasagna. First, I preheated the oven. Then, I mixed up the filling for the lasagna. The filling contained ricotta cheese, one egg, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, spinach, and salt and pepper. Then I got a glass casserole dish from my cupboard and coated it with cooking spray so that the food would not stick to it. I then put a layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. Next I put the dry lasagna noodles and a layer of the cheese mixture I made. I then repeated these steps until the dish was full. I put extra mozzarella cheese on top. I poured a cup of water around the edges of the dish so that the noodles would soak up this liquid while they cooked. I then put the dish in the oven and set a timer for one hour. When the timer went off, I checked on the lasagna. It was ready. My partner and I ate it for dinner and it was delicious.
293	making a shopping list	On Monday I usually go grocery shopping, so I decided to make my shopping list in the morning. First, I decided what meals I would make during the week and thought about all of the ingredients I would need to prepare the meals. I looked in my fridge and pantry to see what ingredient I was missing. I made sure to write these missing items down on my list. I also looked at commonly used items, such as milk, bread, and eggs to make sure that I had them. I wrote down anything that was almost gone or completely gone. I then wrote down any household items that I needed, like paper towels and laundry soap. I also thought ahead about any supplies I would need for the upcoming week. I am planning to have friend over this weekend for a cookout, and needed paper plates. I included these on my list. After finishing my list, I read through it and double checked it before taking it with me to the grocery store.
294	answering the phone	Yesterday, my friend said she would call me in the afternoon. I hadn't heard from her in a while, and I was excited to speak with her after so long. She said she would call my landline phone at home. I waited around the house for her call, listening intently for the ring of the telephone. At around 3:30 in the afternoon, I heard the phone ring. I was upstairs when the phone started ringing, and had to run downstairs to get the phone before the call would get to voicemail. I answered the phone a bit breathlessly by saying, "Hello, this is Kathryn." My friend responded that it was her. I greeted her enthusiastically and asked how she was doing. We ended up chatting for thirty minutes, and it was a great conversation! It was fun to catch up with my friend on the phone. After our call, I hung up.
295	sending food back (in a restaurant)	I went to a sushi restaurant by myself last Friday. I like to sit at the sushi bar because it is easier to get good service, but the restaurant was very busy, so I had to sit at a table instead of at the sushi bar. A waitress came to take my order. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and the waitress said my order would be ready in about ten minutes. When the waitress brought my order, she didn't bring be a spicy tuna roll, but instead she brought me a California roll. I told the waitress she brought me the wrong order, so I had her take it back.  After about ten more minutes, the waitress came back and apologized for bringing me the wrong order, and she gave me the spicy tuna roll I ordered. The waitress felt so bad she offered to pay for my sushi.
296	laying flooring in a room	John was getting ready to move into a new house. He was excited but needed to do some work on the house before he could actually move in. He decided he wanted to replace the carpets in the living room of his new house so he stripped the old carpet of the living room with his buddies that were there to help him. He pulled up the carpet and got rid of it and made sure the floor was okay. It was fine to work with so he got the padding for the room out of his truck and brought it into the living room. He padded down the floor with his friends. He put it down across the entire room and proceeded to get the carpet out of his truck now. He brought the carpet in with his friends and placed it down across the entire room. He was happy with how it looked with the finished result.
297	visiting a doctor	My ears started hurting on Monday. By Thursday, the pain hadn't gone away. I was concerned. Immediately, I picked up my phone and made a doctor's appointment. When the appointment came around, I walked in to the reception area. I told the lady behind the desk who I was. She asked to see my medical card, and I gave it to her promptly. Then she gave me a form to fill out while I waited. Finally, a nurse came out and called my name. I went with her through a door to a large hallway. She took my height and weight. Then she led me to a private room. She took my blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and asked why I was there that day. After she was done, she left me in the room alone. I waited. The doctor came and asked me similar questions. He determined I had an ear infection. I left the doctor's office with a prescription for antibiotics. I knew it would make me feel much better!
298	making breakfast	I awoke on Saturday already excited. I was excited because weekends are the only real times where I get to eat a home cooked breakfast. During the week, we are rushing out of the house, and my husband and I are lucky if we have time to shovel a cereal bar down our throats before we leave the house. We walked down stairs, and I began preparing breakfast for my husband and I. I decided on eggs and bacon for this Saturday's breakfast. I crack the eggs on the side of the bowl, drop them in the bowl, and begin whisking away. I always make sure to add a little bit of milk to make the eggs fluffier. I drop them in the pan and listen as they sizzle away. As they cook, I fry up some bacon in a hot pan. I prefer my bacon crispy, as my husband prefers his bacon a bit more tender. When the meal is done cooking, I put it on a plate and we sit down to eat. We take our time and really savor every bits. I love lazy Saturdays.
299	setting the dining table	I wanted to have a bog dinner party with all of my friends; so. I a started to prepare a huge feast. I put the big sectional into my dinning room table and went to my closest to get my best table cloth to put over my table. After I covered it just right I brought out my finest china from my cabinet and started to spread the dishes out at each of the seats. I placed each plate in its spot complete with forks, knives, and spoons. Next thing I had to do was get my crystal glasses out so I could put one by each of the plates and fill them with water for my guests. After my friends had arrived and I served them we raised our glasses in a toast to or relationships. We had a lovely meal and they stayed to help me clear the table and put back all the dishes were they belonged.
300	going dancing	My girlfriend and I decided that we wanted to do something different for a date night tonight.  We looked through possible things to do in the area, and decided on dancing at a swing dancing club.  We got dressed in some nice, but easy to move in clothes, got in the car, and drove to the club.  We had a couple of drinks at the bar while watching the others dance on the dance floor  before joining them ourselves.  When we got on the floor, we danced together, doing spins and dips in time with the music coming from the stage.  We would take breaks in between some songs to cool off and get drinks, before heading back out for more dancing.  Eventually, there was a dancing competition, and we lasted for two rounds before getting eliminated, but we didn't mind, since we had a great time.  We then went home.
301	answering the doorbell	I was sitting on the couch in my living room when I heard a loud "ding dong!" chime through the house. I got up from the couch and walked to my front door. The doorbell rang again as I made my way to the front of the house. "Ding dong!" Once I was standing at the door, I raised myself up on my toes a little to be able to see out of the peephole. I saw that the person at the door was my mail delivery person. I unlocked the bolt on the door, turned the doorknob, and slowly opened the heavy wooden door and then the screen door. Once the doors were open, I cheerily greeted the mail delivery person and took the mail they handed to me. Once I had taken the mail, I then wished them a good day and I closed the door behind them as they left.
302	playing a movie	Sometimes I love to watch movies with my husband. When we don't have the kids home to disturb us we like to buy a move on demand right from our own living room. The last time we decided to play a movie, my husband went to the "on demand" feature on our TV and scrolled through all the "new release" movies that were available. We both saw a few movies that we wanted to watch, but we didn't want to watch all of the same movies, so we needed to decide on one. We finally decided to watch a movie we both agreed on. He pressed "buy" on the remote and the movie started playing. We both watched the movie in quiet without any one disturbing us. It was really nice. I look forward to having those movie days with my husband since they are few and far between these days.
303	checking in at an airport	My daughter and I had to go to the airport to get on a airplane to go on a trip.  We got there early in the morning so we could have a lot of time.  We  checked to see if we could still get on the plane on time.  We checked to see if we had our passports which we had to have if we wanted to go on a plane.  We had to make sure we were at the right place because we didn't want to get lost.  We had to find our airplane.  You can get lost on them like you can a bus.  We found it.  We still had fifty minutes so we went in the airport restaurant to get a cup of coffee and a donut.  The donut was delicious.  It had jelly in the middle.  We checked our bags to make sure we had everything then we got on the plane.
304	sending party invitations	I was very excited for my birthday party. About a month before my birthday, I helped my mom pick the date and location for my party. Mom called the local fun center and reserved the date. Mom told me I could invite ten friends. I was so excited! Mom got a notebook and I told her the ten friends I wanted to invite. After this, I got to pick my theme! Of course, I chose my favorite movie, Ghostbusters! We went to the party store and got decorations and invitations. Mom looked up my friends' addresses. I helped her fill out the invitations and I even put the stamps on the envelope. After we filled out all of the invitations and addressed the envelopes, we walked to the post office. Mom had to help me put them in the box because I couldn't reach. I am so excited for my party!
305	cooking pasta	I recently made spaghetti for dinner. I first got out a large pot, filled it with water, and placed it on a burner turned up to high heat. I also put a dash of salt into the water, since this is supposed to help it boil more quickly. While this heated, I grabbed a box of dry pasta and measured out the amount that I wanted into another container. I poured the pasta into the water once it was boiling. I allowed the pasta to boil for 8 minutes, according to the directions of the pasta box. I set a timer to prevent overcooking. One the timer went off, I stopped it, turned off the burner, and put on oven mitts. I also placed a colander into the sink. While wearing the oven mitts, I poured the pasta and water into the colander. I then removed the colander from the sink and placed the pasta into a bowl so that it was ready to have sauce added to it.
306	going to the dentist	I went to the dentist yesterday. I brushed my teeth first, because dentists like that, and I left in plenty of time, so I wouldn't be late. When I got to the office, I told the man behind the counter who I was, and that I had an appointment with Dr. Tsutaoka. He told me to have a seat. I sat in the waiting room and watched the television a while. Soon, a woman came and led me back to a small room with a big padded chair. She had me sit in the chair, and tucked a sort of paper napkin around my neck. Then the dentist came in and smiled and said hi. She asked how I was feeling, and I said I was fine. She told me she was just going to look at my teeth, and she did. She pushed a button and the chair whirred and slowly tilted back. I opened wide, and she looked at my teeth one by one, using a small round mirror on a thin metal stick to see them. She said everything looked good, and I should keep brushing and flossing. I told her I would. She was nice, and I'll see her again in six months.
307	planning a holiday trip	Taking a trip to celebrate a holiday is a wonderful experience.  I decided to take a trip to New York City this year to celebrate New Years Eve with friends.  My first question was if I should stay in a hotel or with friends.  Due to the cost of hotels I decided that staying with friends was the very best option.  I then decided that to travel to New York City my best choice would be to take the train.  The train trip from Boston to New York City is relatively short and it's very convenient because the train stop is very close to my friends apartment.  My friends and I then decided that we should make dinner reservations for a nice new years dinner in New York.  I took care of the reservations for dinner and the train and now I am just waiting a couple of months so I can take this really exciting trip.
308	making a hot dog	I felt very hungry so I looked in my fridge for something to eat. A hot dog package caught my eye. It looked tasty to eat and thought it could curb my hunger.  I took out the package and read the instructions for cooking. There are a few different ways to cook hot dogs, microwave, boiling on the barbeque or grill. I decided since I was so hungry already and did not want to wait long I would use the microwave method. I opened up the package and took out a hot dog. Placing it on a paper towel I set the cook time for 20 seconds. It was ready then but very hot. I took out a bun and then spread some mustard, relish and ketchup on it as well. I then placed the hot dog in the bun and eat it all.  It was very tasty and satisfied my hunger.
309	taking a shower	In the morning, I always make sure taking a shower is the very first thing I do for the day. I take off my clothing and get the shower running, so the water will be nice and hot when I go in. Once it's ready, I hop inside and start washing. I take the soap and wash all over my body. I wash my arms, my legs, my back, and my feet. I make sure my entire body is nicely soaped up and cleaned, then I rinse all the soap off. Then, I wash my hair by getting it wet and adding shampoo and conditioner. Once I'm all rinsed off, I'm done showering. I get out of the shower and take my towel to dry myself off. I put on some deodorant, to make sure I keep smelling fresh for the rest of the day. Once I'm all washed up, I get dressed and I'm ready to face my day!
310	washing clothes	As I walked around the house, gathering up all the dirty clothes sometimes smelling them if I was unsure of their dirtiness. Then I separated colors. Sorting whites from colored clothing. Jeans from the more delicate ones. Starting with a load of white as they are usually smaller I start the water before pouring in just a cap full of bleach. Once that load has finished I move it to the dryer, with a dryer sheet to help soften and scent the clothes. Then I place the other clothes in the washer and pour in the measured amount of laundry detergent. It goes through a wash and then a rinse cycle before they are ready for the dryer. I take the whites out the dryer so I can move the next load in. Again a dryer sheet is placed. This also helps remove lint. Check the lint trap clean it if necessary and start drying that load!
311	throwing a party	On Saturday, our family had a party for my uncle's birthday. We went to the store for party foods and drinks. We bought four kinds of soda and three kinds of chips, plus dips and some cut raw vegetables. We had called the day before to order a cake from the store's bakery. We also bought paper plates, plastic forks, and paper napkins that said 
312	papering a room	I asked someone at Home Depot about this since I've never done it before. They were very helpful. They told me how to figure out how much wallpaper I would need. I had to get a tape measure and measure all four walls. I had to measure how high they were and how wide they were. Then there was this formula where you multiplied the height times the width, divided that by 144 . . . and that's as far as I got. Wallpaper isn't that expensive and I didn't mind having some left over.  So, I just made a guess when I picked out my wallpaper. I can always get more if I need it. I finally got everything out of my bedroom. Other than my bed, the room was totally empty. Then I made a table out of two saw-horses and a board. I opened the package and unrolled a sheet of wallpaper on the table. I peeled the backing off, climbed the ladder, aligned it with the ceiling and affixed it to the wall.
313	feeding an infant	I was in the kitchen tidying up and suddenly heard the baby crying from her crib. She must have awoken from her nap. I ran upstairs to hold and coddle her, and realized she wasn't being soothed. I knew she didn't need a diaper change as I had just changed her before her nap and her diaper felt dry. I realized she must be hungry. I brought her back downstairs and opened the fridge to get out a bottle of milk. I brought her and the bottle to the couch, sat her on my lap, and brought the nipple of the bottle to her lips. The baby suckled onto the bottle and I could hear her sucking in the milk. After a few minutes, she released her lips from the nipple, indicating to me that she had had enough to eat. I set the bottle down and placed the baby over my shoulder to burp her.
314	changing a light bulb	I flipped up the light switch to illuminate my federal, and instantly watched as the lightbulb went on and then immediately shut off. That let me know that the lightbulb was blown, and that it needed to be changed. First I went to the linen closet, and removed a brand-new lightbulb from the box. I went back to the bedroom and turned the light switch back into the off position. I then placed a stool underneath the lightbulb, and climbed on top carefully, with the new label in one hand. Once I was in position to remove the old lightbulb, I placed the new lightbulb on the top of the stool in a safe place, then placed my hand on the blown lightbulb to inshore it was not too hot to handle. Once I realized the lightbulb was cool to the touch, I began to screw the light above in a clockwise motion in order to remove the lightbulb from the light fixture. Once the lightbulb was release, I bent over and placed the old bowl on the top of the stool, then picked up the brand-new lightbulb. I then stood back up so that I could reach the light fixture, and placed the middle portion of the lightbulb into the light fixture. I began to screw the lightbulb in a counterclockwise motion, ensuring that the metal thread of the lightbulb was aligned correctly with the light fixture to inshore that the lightbulb would be evenly inserted into the opening. Once the lightbulb was completely emplaced, then I stepped down off of the stool and back onto the floor, removing the old light bold and the stool from the middle of the room. Then, to check to make sure that the new ball had been inserted correctly, I flicked the light switch from the off position to the on position and looked up to see that the new label of have been illuminated.
315	changing bed sheets	This morning I decided to do my dirty laundry and to clean my dirty bed sheets. First I took my blanket and pillows off of my bed. Then I grabbed onto my bed sheet and pulled it off of my bed. I crumpled my bed sheet in my arms and carried it to my washing machine. I put my dirty laundry and my dirty bed sheets in the washing machine and added laundry detergent to it. I then set my machine to the correct settings and pressed the button to start the laundry. Now I needed some clean sheets on my bed, so I went to my closet when I keep the clean bedding. I found a clean sheet and carried it back to my bedroom. I unfolded the sheet and matched up the corners of the sheet with the corners of my bed. I laid the sheet on my bed and tucked in the sides of the sheet that were hanging over my bed. Then I put my blanket and pillows back on the bed. Now I had clean sheets!
316	making a camping trip	Regina had thought about renting an RV for their family camping trip, and now looking at the car stuffed full of everything her family could think of, she was regretting not getting it. Seeing his wife looking slightly sad, Aaron walked over and hugged her. They stared at the mess together for a few minutes and laughed together. The kids came running back to the car with the various toys and games that a three and five year old needed. Regina asked Aaron to check that everything they had packed was strapped down. As he went to do that, she buckled her little boys in. Then got out her list from the glove box. She went to the back of the car and started checking off things she could see. The grill; check, the kids suitcases; check, her and Aaron's suitcases; check, the bikes; check, propane; check, extra camping odds and ends; check, and her wonderful and adoring family; double check. She smiled as she put the list away and Aaron started the car. They happily sped off on their week away at Yellowstone National Park.
317	changing batteries in an alarm clock	I was getting ready to set the alarm so that I could wake up early  the next morning when I realized that's the batteries were dead and needed to be changed. So I took the battery cover off of the bottom of the alarm clock, which is where I saw the the two dead AA batteries. I took the batteries out, one by one, and through the old batteries in the garbage. I then opened a brand-new store-bought pack of AA batteries, and removed two of them from the packaging. Following the direct actions within the battery compartment of the alarm clock, I inserted each of the batteries one by one, ensuring that the positive and negative terminals were facing in the correct directions. Once both batteries were in place and snugly intact, I put the battery cover back on the bottom of the alarm clock in order to secure the batteries in place. I then turned over the clock so that it was sitting right side up and facing me. I push the power button and the face of the clock lit up, with 12 o'clock blinking in red.
318	making tea	In the afternoons, sometimes I like to have a cup of tea and relax out on my back deck while reading a book and enjoying some piece and quiet.  First, I went into the kitchen and took out my tea kettle.  I filled it with water and put it on the stove.  I turned on the stove and let the kettle warm.  While the water inside the kettle was getting hot, I looked through my cupboard and pulled out my box of tea bags. I looked through my choices and decided on a peppermint tea.  I then got out a tea cup and put the bag in the cup.  After several minutes my tea kettle started to whistle, signally that the water was hot enough. I carefully took the tea kettle off of the stove, being cautious not to burn myself.  I slowly poured the water into the tea cup and let the bag soak in the hot water.  Afterwards, I took my tea cup out to the deck and sat down with my favorite book.
319	vacuuming the carpet	My wife and I decided to invite some friends over.  We wanted to clean our and house and make it look good after it was messed up by my daughter.  One of the first things that we did to clean was to get out the vacuum.  To do so, I opened up the door to the closet and got it out of there.  I took the plug and put it in a socket that was close to the area of the floor that I wanted to clean.  I hit the power button and the vacuum started to make a weird noise.  I opened the vacuum up and cleaned the inside out.  After that, it was ready to get started.  I pushed the vacuum all over the floor in every part of the house.  It was very loud and it was nice to push the power button and turn it off when I was finished.
320	going grocery shopping	Yesterday I went grocery shopping . I left my house and drove to the store . I parked the car , walked inside and grabbed a shopping cart . I looked at my list and saw that I needed some fresh produce . I picked out the best looking strawberries , they were on sale for $ 2 a pound . I bought several pounds because my daughter loves fresh strawberries . I finished up in the produce section , buying some things to make a green salad later to go with dinner . I then stopped at the meat section and picked out some nice cuts of steak for dinner . I went into the frozen foods section and found ice cream was also on sale . I bought vanilla and chocolate . I went through the rest of the aisles , consulting my list and picking out what my family needed . When I had found everything I needed , and put them in my cart , I walked over to the checkout lanes . I stood in line and waited for my turn . Finally , it was my turn and the checkout person checked me out . I paid my bill , and walked out to my car with the shopping cart . Then I loaded the car up with the groceries , returned the cart and drove home . 
321	making omelette	I was hungry.  It was too early for lunch, but too late for breakfast.  I decided to make an omelette.  I cracked a couple of eggs into a glass bowl and added some seasoning.  I also added a little milk to give it some fluffiness.  Then I whipped up and stirred the eggs.  While I was stirring the eggs, I set a pan on the stove and heated a pat of butter.  When it was hot enough, I poured the eggs into the pan.  As the eggs started to cook, I flipped them and cooked them on the other side.  I put a bit of shredded cheese and diced ham on the egg and flipped it over in half.  I turned the heat down and let the egg cool off a bit.  After a minute or two, I slid the omelette off onto a plate.  It was so very delicious!
322	playing a movie	I had holidays in the last week. It was a long weekend and I planned to watch some movie. My father gave an idea to gather my friends and watch some good movie and he promised to help in playing the movie. I invited some of my interested friends to watch the movie. We discussed and decided to watch the animation movie 'Up'. I went to the shop along with my father to buy the DVD for the movie 'Up'. My father taught me to connect the DVD player to our television. Once the player is connected, I had to insert the disc in the player through the proper hole. Once the disc is placed, I had to switch on the play button to get the movie played. After the movie is finished we have to push the stop button and get the disc out of the player. I learned everything well from my father and played the movie once our friends gathered. We all enjoyed the movie well.
323	sending party invitations	My daughter's 10th birthday was coming up in about a month. My husband and I had decided to throw her a party because she was so excited to turn 10 years old. We planned some entertainment for the party and agreed on the food and treats to be served. Then it was time to invite all of her friends to the party. We made a list of her friends with her help. We then looked online for invitations and found a great selection. We let our daughter pick her favorite and ordered 30 of them. When the invitations came we filled out the names for each then addressed the envelopes with only names so that she could hand the invitations out at school. Each invitation explained what the party was for, when it would be, and what to bring and expect. She took the invitations to school the next day and handed them to all of her friends, barely able to contain her excitement. The party was a hit.
324	changing batteries in an alarm clock	My old fashioned alarm clock did not go off this morning, subsequently I was late for work. I didn't have time to change the batteries so I waited until after work. Once home, I picked up the clock and used a Phillips head screwdriver to open the back of the clock. Using my finger nail I pulled on each of the two batteries from one side until they came loose. I put the dead batteries in the used battery drawer for recycling at a later date. I grabbed two fresh batteries from the adjacent drawer. I popped the batteries, making sure the positive and negatives were properly aligned and I screwed the plate back on with the screwdriver. I had to reset the time which wasn't hard, I just turned the dial on the back until it was correct. I then reset the alarm as well so that I would not be late from oversleeping the next day as well.
325	painting a wall	This room sure needs and update with a more vibrant color, like yellow. Yes, yellow is the color Max is channeling for this room, but it has to be the right shade of yellow. Off to the hardware store, there is canary yellow, banana yellow, and pale yellow. Decisions, decisions, pale yellow it is and a primer too. Max dust and clear the walls, and covers large furniture. Because, of the existing color the walls will need to be primed before painting. Max fills the painting pan and uses the roller to prime the walls. Using the roller was tough, so Max used the sprayer machine to paint the walls. Hum, hum, hum the machine sprayed forcefully a thin layer of paint, in all there were three layers of paint. The sprayer made the job much easier, and Max was very pleased with the color pale yellow. The walls dried over night and Max uncovered the furniture and updated the room with new pictures, curtains and accessories. Max was very happy with the end results.
326	playing a movie	Last time I played a movie, I was at home with my girlfriend and was somewhat bored. I  was looking for something to do and I knew that neither of us had seen a movie in a long time. As a result, I found a DVD and we watched it. I had to go downstairs to find a comedy movie that would be enjoyable to both of us, since that was the type of movie that we wanted to watch. Once I found the movie, I put it into the DVD player and started to watch. We both relaxed and watching the movie. Later, I had to turn the volume up because we were having trouble seeing. Since we got tired about half way through the movie, I had to set the sleep timer on the TV so that it would not remain on all night. However, we did end up staying awake throughout the duration of the movie.
327	making a camping trip	It was the first warm sunny weekend in May, so I was excited to head up into the mountains and camp. I checked through my camping box to make sure I had camp stove fuel, batteries for the flashlights, camp utensils, bug spray and everything else I might need. I also double checked to make sure all the stakes and poles were with my tent. Lastly I loaded up a cooler with food and snacks. I rounded up the kids and we got into the car. We drove half an hour away on the highway before turning onto a Forest Service Road. After about 15 minutes we pulled into a campground. We selected a spot, looking for one that was well shaded and set back from the road. The kids took the tent out and began putting poles together. I helped them stake out the tent. Then we gathered up firewood together and placed it in the fire ring. I got some matches from the box and lit some of the smaller twigs. I poked around the fire until it began to burn well and then started to get out some food for dinner.
328	planning a holiday trip	I wanted to plan a trip to visit my Dad in Maui so decided to go over Thanksgiving because I could stay for longer and would not have to use as many vacation days. I confirmed with him that the dates were OK and started looking at airfare. The best prices I could find consisted of two layovers and included an overnight flight but I was willing to suffer a little bit to save a few hundred dollars. After I booked my flight I gave my Dad the information and he said he would schedule some days off to spend with me. I did some research on things I would like to do in Maui and decided I wanted to go whale watching and possibly snorkeling if the weather was nice. Dad made the reservations since he gets a discount as a resident. I also found some restaurants that I wanted to try. I thought about if I needed to buy anything before I went and decided to pack light and purchase essentials there to not risk my bag getting lost. The trip went as planned and was very relaxing and beautiful.
329	cleaning the table	Maria helps clean the table after dinner.  She takes the plates first, scrapes the food off of them, and throws away the scraps. She sets the dishes near the sink. Then, she takes the cups two at a time, and empties them in the sink if there is any drink left in them.  She sets them next to the counter where the sink is to be washed.   Then she gathers the silverware, and any other dishes with food in them.  She wipes the table carefully, and puts back the flower decoration onto the center of the table.  She then goes back to the kitchen, to rinse the dishes, and prepare them for the dishwasher.  She loads the dishwasher with the dirty dishes, and puts the soap in the dishwasher.  She turns on the dishwasher, and goes to tell her mom that she done with the dishes and cleaning the table.
330	chopping vegetables	Tonight for dinner, I decided that I wanted to make a chopped salad to accompany my dinner of spaghetti and bread sticks. In order to make a chopped salad, I knew that I would need to chop vegetables. First, I decided which vegetables I wanted to chop. I decided that I wanted carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, and iceberg lettuce in my salad. I carefully washed the vegetables to remove any dirt or sand that might have gotten on them. I then got out my wooden cutting board and my chopping knife, which is sharp enough to easily slice through hard foods like cucumbers. I placed the washed vegetables on the chopping board and carefully chopped up the vegetables, one by one. I tried to chop the vegetables so that they were of similar sizes and shapes. I then put all of the chopped vegetables into a mixing bowl and used a mixing spoon to stir them together.
331	cleaning the table	Every Saturday my family comes over to my house for dinner. It's very enjoyable seeing all the people that I love. My wife and I cook a large meal with plenty of food for everyone. We all sit at the table and eat and talk and laugh and have a really nice time. Once dinner is over we begin to clean up. We gather up all of the dirty dishes and silverware and rinse them off in the sink and then put them in the dishwasher. After the table is cleared off it needs to be cleaned. So I gather together a clean, dry rag and some kitchen cleaner, and spray the cleaner on the table. I make sure to spray all the sticky spots because they can be harder to clean off. I then take my rag and wipe it over the table, over and over again until the table is dry and completely clean. The table becomes so shiny and bright that it looks brand new. I then put the cleaner away and place the cleaning rag in the washing machine. After this I wash my hands thoroughly and then move on to whatever else is left to do.
332	chopping vegetables	I was in my kitchen about to cook dinner for my boyfriend and myself. We were going to have steak and some saut¨¦ed vegetables. I had already put the steak in the oven and was about to begin saut¨¦ing the vegetables. I pulled a zucchini and a yellow squash out of the refrigerator and placed them on my cutting board. I grabbed a knife from our knife block and began to cut the vegetables. I first cut them into equal sized rounds, but those would be too big to bite so I decided to cut them again. I cut each round in half so it was in the shape of a semicircle. All of my vegetables were cut, but I decided to put one more vegetable in with the mix. I pulled some grape tomatoes out of the refrigerator and put about ten of them on my cutting board. I cut them all in half and poured them into the pan along with my yellow squash and zucchini.
333	applying band aid	I rinsed the fresh wound with cold water, then held pressure on it for a few minutes with a dry paper towel. Once the wound stopped bleeding I gently applied some peroxide and let it dry. I then applied a thin layer of neo sporin. I had to search for band aids and eventually found one in the first aid kit in the car. I found an appropriate sized band aid removed the wrapper and threw the wrapper away. I peeled one side of the band aid sticky cover off, one sticky side exposed,  I stuck it on bare skin just to the side of the wound. I then peeled off the other side and gently pressed the band-aid to my skin, making sure the wound was centered and properly covered by the pad part of the band aid. I tried my best not to get the wounded are and band aid damp over the next few days. I also reapplied a bandage at least once a day for 3 days until the wound stayed closed on its own.
334	applying band aid	I bumped into the corner of the table, and when I look down at my knee, I noticed that I had a scratch and there was blood running from it. That meant that I needed to get a Band-Aid, but first I need to clean the area to ensure I would not get an infection. I used a paper towel, wet it with water, then wiped the area to ensure the Nazi other than my schooling. I then use a kind of all to soak up some alcohol and of by its to the cuts, which had a stinging, tingling feeling. I then got a Band-Aid, and removed the packaging around it. Next I pulled back one of the white strips to reveal bus sticky parts of the Band-Aid, as well as the center cotton so that I could align its with the scratch. Once I placed the center square cotton onto the scratch and insured it was in the place that I wanted the Band-Aid to be, I secured the exposed side of the adhesive part of the Band-Aid, then remove the white protective slip to expose the other half of the adhesive part of the Band-Aid. With both adhesives stuck to my skin, I gave the band they want a final with my finger to assure that it was secure against my skin, and now the Band-Aid was applied.
335	applying band aid	Ouch! I cut myself! When you get a cut, it's very important to apply a bandage to it as soon as possible. I go to the bathroom, where I keep my first aid supplies. The first thing to do is wash the cut. I have to wash away the blood and whatever dirt that may have gotten into the wound. Then, I apply disinfectant. If I don't apply the disinfectant, the germs that are already in the cut could cause an infection, and that could make me very sick. Finally, it's time to put on a bandage. I take a bandage from the box, unwrap it, and stick it right over my wound. It's very important to wrap the bandage tightly, so it stays stuck on my skin. When the bandage gets old and dirty, I carefully take it off and put a fresh one on, applying more disinfectant so I don't get sick. Soon enough, my cut has healed!
336	applying band aid	Around 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to my mailbox in the front of my house to retrieve my weekday mail. As I opened the mailbox I saw that it was full, so I grabbed all the letters and mail with two hands. I walked back towards the front door and went inside my house to open the letters I received in the mail. I opened the first letter, then the second, by the third letter I must have gotten distracted and ripped the envelope to quickly. That's when I felt the edge of the paper rip into my finger. Automatically, I reacted and dropped the letter on the table and saw the slit on my finger in which it started to bleed. I headed to the bathroom and in the medicine cabinet I pulled out the first aid kit. I rinsed my finger under warm water and disinfected it with alcohol. Then I patted dry my finger and opened an medium sized band aid to place it on my finger. I peeled the backing on the band aid and place it over the small cut on my finger. I wrapped my finger with the band aid and clean up. Then I headed back to open the rest of my mail.
337	applying band aid	I cut my hand yesterday on a sharp piece of glass, so I had to apply a band aid to keep it from getting infected. First, I had to go into the bathroom and get the package of band aids out of the medicine cabinet above the sink. I took a band aid out of the box and removed the paper wrapper that keeps it clean and sterile. I set it off to the side, then turned on the water in the sink and adjusted the temperature until it was warm. Next, I washed my cut to make sure it was clean, then I dried my hands on the towel hanging above the toilet. I took the band aid and gently placed it over the cut, taking care to make sure that the adhesive stuck to my skin so the band aid wouldn't fall off. Finally, I threw away the paper wrapper that the band aid came in, and left the bathroom to finish my day.
338	applying band aid	I cut myself just enough to bleed, but not enough to need to go to the hospital. I needed to wash the cut and put on a band aid, so it would not get anything dirty in the cut. I went to the medicine cabinet and got out the box of band aids. I also got a bottle of wound wash, peroxide. I held the finger I cut over the sink, and poured the peroxide over the wound. It stung a little, but I did it so I knew my cut was clean. I let the peroxide fizzle then dry for a moment. Once it was dry, I opened the band aid. I had to removed it from the box, then the paper it was wrapped in, the take the pieces of wax paper off the sticky parts. Once I did I held my finger out and used my other hand to put the soft part on the cut. I wrapped the band aid around my finger and picked up all the papers that were on it.
339	applying band aid	I have a problem with picking scabs off of my skin. One of the only ways I can combat this is to apply a band aid over the areas to prevent myself from picking at them. To put on the band aid, I open the wrapper and then take off the two little pieces of glossy paper protecting the sticky adhesive side. I then place the band aid over the spot that I either picked already or want to prevent myself from picking. Once i do that, I throw away all the band aid remnants. The band aid itself is a peach, off-white sort of color -- I hesitate to say "nude" because that implies that everyone has the same skin tone, which is untrue. I usually leave the band aid on for as long as possible, which typically ends up being until I shower next. Sometimes I will use small circle band aids if I do not have a full band aid available.
340	applying band aid	I was working in the back yard and I cut my finger on a piece of sharp wood.  I then headed back into the house and washed my hand to make sure the wound was clean and free of dirt and infection.  After washing my hands and the wound with hot, soapy water I put some ointment on the cut to help it heal faster and keep infections out.  I reached into the cabinet and opened the band-aid box so I could take a band-aid out.  I realized that this box didn't have the right size so being careful with use my non-cut hand I reached into another cabinet and found the right sized band-aid.  I tore open the package, pealed back the plastic, and put it over the cut making sure I put the band-aid on nice and tight.  Making sure that the band-aid was secure I headed back out into the yard to finish up my work.

That kitten did not like to have his tail pulled and he scratched Lucy right on her arm.  Poor Lucy, she had a bad scrape and she needed a band aid.  She asked her mother to help her.  They got the band aid out of the box and carefully unwrapped it.  Then Lucy's mother gently cleaned her scrape and applied a little bit of ointment.  They peeled the paper off the back of the band aid and gently applied it to the scrape.  Lucy knew that it was important to keep the band aid on for a few days until the scrape started to heal.  After the band aid was on and she got a hug from her mother Lucy felt so much better!
342	applying band aid	I fell down on my driveway this morning and scraped my knee. It hurt, and it was bleeding a little bit. I went into my bathroom and carefully washed my knee with soap and water. I pat the area dry with a towel. I knew it would be very important to keep the area clean so it would not get infected. Therefore, I applied the antibiotic ointment I keep in my bathroom drawer to the scrape on my knee. I used a cotton swab instead of my fingers, so I wouldn't get the sticky ointment everywhere. I then decided to put a band aid on, to help keep germs out. I tore the plastic backings off the sticky part and placed the band aid on top of my wound, over the ointment. It gently pressed my fingers on the band aid's edges to make sure it would stay in place. After that, my knee felt much better.

I peeled back the strips of paper that enclose the band aid and placed them on the counter. I split open the band aid, revealing the white pad that absorbs blood. I placed it over the wound and then pulled back the two plastic strips that revealed the adhesive. I pulled them snug and fixed the band aid into place. I smoothed the surface out and made sure it was a good fit. I then picked up the trash from the band aids and threw it away.
344	applying band aid	This morning, when I was sharpening a knife, I cut my thumb and needed to put a band aid. First, I went to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom where I keep the first aid kid. I opened up the kit and looked for a band aid that would work for the cut. Some of the band aids were too big, and wouldn't fit on my thumb without hanging over the tip, some were too small and wouldn't cover the cut on my thumb. I dug through the band aid bag and found a band aid that would fit. Next, I washed my hands thoroughly to make sure the cut was clean and then I dried my hands with a clean towel., Then I put some antiseptic ointment from the first aid kit on the cut, to help the cut heal faster and reduce the chance of getting an infection. Finally, with my cut cleaned and treated, I wrapped it carefully with a band aid.
345	applying band aid	While doing yard work around my house, I had an accident with the hedge clippers. My finger  was cut when I picked up the clippers by the blade. The cut was not large so a band-aid would be a suitable fix. I stopped my work and went inside to get one. I went to the bathroom to clean the wound before I applied the band-aid. I scrubbed it with soap and water, and then afterwards I applied some antiseptic. Once clean and sterile, I took a band-aid from the box and took off the adhesive backing. Very carefully, I wrapped my finger with the fresh band-aid making sure it was not too tight. When it was on, I flexed my hand to make sure it would not fall off or get in the way. When I was satisfied, I cleaned up the mess in the bathroom and put a work glove over my hand to protect the band-aid from the work to come.
346	applying band aid	Today I got a small cut on my leg from riding my mountain bike. It was bleeding a bit. I headed home to clean up.

I put soap on the wash cloth and dampened it with warm water. I then gently cleaned my leg up. I then patted it try and took a cotton ball and soaked it with some alcohol. I then swabbed the cut with a circular motion with the cotton ball in order to disinfect it. I grabbed the band aid and opened up the wrapper. I removed the backings to the band aid and placed the middle portion over the cut. I rubbed the two sticky sides on my leg so they would stick. I then put all of the materials away and went on about my day.
347	applying band aid	One day, I decided to make dinner.  I needed to cut an onion to make what I wanted to eat, so I got out a knife, an onion, and a cutting board, and started to cut the onion.  I wasn't paying attention, and I accidentally cut my finger with the sharp knife!  I put the knife down, and went to the bathroom, opened the medicine cabinet, and took out a box of band aids.  I also ran my cut finger under water, to clean it before I put the band aid on.  I took a band aid out of the box, and unwrapped it, so I could put it on my finger.  Then, I dried my finger off, and wrapped the band aid around the cut.  It fit snugly, and so I put the box of band aids back into the cabinet, closed the cabinet door, and went back to cooking dinner.
348	applying band aid	It was a sunny day and my sister and I were outside playing away the day. We decided it would be a good idea to have scooter races. With her on her red scooter and me on my blue scooter, we raced down the sidewalk at top speeds. Before I knew it, she began to wobble uncontrollably in front of me. She tried to jump off into the grass before crashing, but she landed hard on the pavement. I rushed to help her and noticed her knee was bleeding quite a bit. We walked slowly home to tend to her wounds. I took her into the bathroom and washed off her wound with soap and water. I then dried her wound with a clean towel. I reached into the cabinet and found the nearest bandages I could find. I peeled open the band-aid and took off the plastic strips. I put the padded part of the band-aid over her wound and pressed the adhesive down around it. She was ready to race again!
349	applying band aid	I was in kitchen and cutting some vegetables with knife which I just sharpened . I think I was cutting so close to my fingers, and doing multi task, the knife cut my finger. The blood was gushing out, I tried to stop with  water. Then I went to my medicine cabinet, and grabbed a box of band aid. The cut was big, so I was looking for long and wide one, which cover my cut. I found one which has some antiseptic cream on.  I cleaned my wound, and pressed cotton on wound for a while till the blood stopped. Finally when it stopped then I peeled the paper from the band aid, and it exposed the sticky part of band aid. I immediately put the sticky part on my skin adjusting it according to my wound, so cushiony antiseptic part directly falls on my wound and covers it nicely. Then I pressed both side so it sticks to my finger well and wrapped around my finger securely.
350	applying band aid	Carrie came running into the house screaming at the top of her lungs, and collapsed at Laura's still moving feet. "What's the matter baby? What happened," Laura asked as she stooped down to look at the minor scrape on Carrie's knee. "Matty pushed me down on the swing," she said through stained lips. "He pushed me real hard." Carries put her head down in Laura's lap there in the kitchen floor. She swooped Carrie up with a little extra spin just for fun. "Let's go put a cool band aid on it, and you can go show him that all he did was get you a sticker," Laura said to her trying to cheer her up. Carries snuggled tighter to her mom as Laura flipped the bathroom light on. In the medicine cabinet, she always kept Hello Kitty and Power Ranger band aids, just in case of this happening. After cleaning the cut with antiseptic, and kissing her now happy little girl, Laura had put a hot pink band aid with Hello Kitty smiling brightly from Carrie's knee. It wasn't two minutes later that she was right out the door to show the boys how tough she was.
351	buying from a vending machine	I'm feeling thirsty. Fortunately, there's a vending machine that I can get a drink from here. Vending machines are special machines that automatically sell things like food, drinks, and other little things. Today, I'm going to buy a bottle of water from this machine. The first thing I do is put in my money. I put in one dollar, the price of the bottle I want. Then, I put in the number for the water. Every item in the machine has its own number, which you punch into a special pad to order it. Once I press the number, the machine pushes the bottle of water down, where it falls into a slot where I can pick it up from. Some machines instead grab the bottle and carry it down gently, especially of it carries bottles made from glass. Now that I've got my water, I don't feel so thirsty anymore!
352	buying from a vending machine	I recently was at a sporting event and decided I was hungry and wanted to buy something to eat.  I spotted a vending machine tucked in the corner of a stairwell that sold small snacks and drinks.  I approached the vending machine and looked through the glass to decide what I wanted.  I found a bag of chips that I know I like and decided that is what I would buy.  I read the price of the chips was one dollar.  I reached into my wallet and retrieved the dollar needed to purchase the chips.  I looked back into the vending machine and found that the chips were located in the B4 position.  I put my dollar into the machine and pressed the "B" button and then the "4" button.  The coiled metal rotated and the bag of chips fell to the bottom of the machine.  I reached through the door at the bottom and retrieved my chips.
353	buying from a vending machine	I approached the vending machine while pulling my wallet out of my back pocket.  I stood in front of the machine and looked through the glass at all the choices in front of me. Did I want a bag of potato chips or a candy bar?  I decided I wanted a Reese's peanut butter cups. The tag in front of the candy bar said $1.50.  I pulled two one dollar bills from wallet and placed them into the money slot and watched the machine grab and pull them inside.  I saw that I now had $2.00 of credit.  I pressed A7 on the keypad which was in front of the Reese's peanut butter cups.  I watched the circular metal wire rotate and push the candy bar forward.  I watched it drop down to bottom of the machine.  I pushed the wide door open and grabbed my candy bar. I heard two quarters fall into the coin return slot.  I pulled them out with one finger and enjoyed my candy bar.
354	buying from a vending machine	I have an important test coming up. So, I've been studying a lot lately. I was studying at the library last night. I set aside four hours to study. But, half way through, my stomach started rumbling. I tried to keep my mind off of it, but my hunger was distracting me from my work. So, I decided to grab something from the vending machine. I stopped studying, and I want to the lounge area of the library. I was surprised by all the great options available. I could choose both hot and cold items. For example, there were tiny sandwiches which could be heated up in a nearby microwave. There were also ice cream sandwiches. I love those frozen treats. I decided, however, just to get some pretzels. I put some change into the vending machine. There were codes for each item available. I entered the code for pretzels into the computer on the side of the machine. And, my pretzels dropped into the bay at the bottom of the machine. I reached into the bay, and I pulled them out. I ate them quickly. They were delicious. I then returned to my homework.

First, I put money into the snack machine and entered the code for the bag of chips that I wanted. Soon after, the snack came out. Then, I went over to the drink dispenser and got a soda. I then opened the chips and started to enjoy them, before enjoying the soda. I had a great little snack and the ordering process was efficient. I had a little trouble getting the snack out of the dispenser, but was able to eventually . My chips were good, as was my soda. My soda was also cold and delicious. I enjoyed it thoroughly and was glad that I used the vending machine this time.
356	buying from a vending machine	I work in a library that has very old vending machines in the basement. Today however, we got new space age vending machines. What makes them space age is that they have a much larger selection of items than our old machines. They're refrigerated so they have sandwiches and pickles and items such as that. Another thing that makes them space age is that they take credit cards as well as cash. Today I don't have cash, so I get to go down to the vending machine with my card. I swipe the card and it tells me my card is accepted. Then I choose my item. Peanut M&M's. It's always peanut M&M's. I put in the letter and number of the item. The machine thinks about it for a second then drops my item. I bend over and push open the door at the bottom. I retrieve my candy and skip away.
357	buying from a vending machine	It usually happens a lot where you're staying at a hotel, it's late at night, and you just want something to snack on. This happened to me during my family's most recent stay at a hotel. It was close to midnight, and I hadn't eaten a proper meal in hours for whatever reason. However, I knew that just down the hall from our hotel room, there were vending machines for both drinks and snacks. Knowing this, I got some loose dollars from my wallet, grabbed a room key, and went to the vending machines down the hall. I looked at the options that they had, and eventually settled for a bag of beef jerky out of the snack machine, as well as a water bottle from the drink machine. After getting my late night snack, I went back to the hotel room and enjoyed my beef jerky. I kept the water at my bedside overnight just in case I woke up thirsty.
358	buying from a vending machine	I first found a dollar bill in my pocket. I walked over to the vending machine and looked through the window to make sure I knew what I wanted. There were many rows of candy, snacks, and drinks to choose from I chose a particular candy bar and looked at the letter and number below it. Remembering that letter and number, I put my dollar in the machine, which took my money. I then touched the letter and number on the keypad. The metal arms that held the candy bar in place pushed forward and the machine dropped my candy bar down into a place where I could reach through a door to pick it up. The machine knew that I put too much money in and I heard the sound of coins falling into a slot on the machine, which I used to hand to remove.  I walked away from the vending machine pleased and let the next person use it.
359	buying from a vending machine	I had a break between my classes and was feeling a little hungry. I walked to the library and went into the basement where the vending machines were. I did not want a whole meal, so a vending machine snack seemed like a good choice. After looking through my options I decided that some animal crackers would do the trick and help me feel full and alert before my next class. I put my seventy five cents into the coin slot and punch in A-4, which was the number under the animal crackers that I wanted. As soon as I did the stop on the animal crackers dropped just long enough for one pack of animal crackers to fall down. I reached down and pushed back the lid on the retrieval drawer. Off I went, happy to have found a vending machine and buy the animal crackers that I desired.
360	buying from a vending machine	After my workout today I wanted to get a snacked to keep my energy up; so I decided to go to the row of vending machines that the gym keeps outside the locker rooms. It's usually a hard decision when I get there, there is so many choices of healthy snacks. I searched the rows of energy bars and veggie snacks to find what would give me the biggest boost after my exercise. I made my choice and reached for the change in my bag so I could pay for my taste treat. I put my coins into the slot in the machine until I had enough to buy my snack. I punched in the number of my selection so the machine could do its work. The coil started to spin until my energy bar fell from its slot. I pushed through the flap to retrieve my bar and started to eat.
361	buying from a vending machine	I am so glad there is a vending machine just outside from my Math classroom.  I woke up late and didn't have a chance to eat breakfast it's 10:00 am and I am hungry I need to get food before lunch! At my morning break I head directly to the courtyard and to the  vending machine. I pull the seven quarters out of my pocket, put it into the money slot of the vending machine and push the numbers one, three, six and the letter A.  This is the code for my favorite go to snack, chocolate covered donuts with sprinkles of coconut and almonds. This morning I am extra hungry and have found five more quarters which is enough for a container of chocolate milk.  I reach into the machine and grab my purchased donuts.  I add the five quarters and press the numbers two, four, three and the letter M.  I grab the container of milk and head over to a bench and dig into my snack.
362	buying from a vending machine	There was a vending machine at my dorm in college. I bought from it often.  One time  stands out more than the others, though.  I have collected exactly $3.15. This was enough for a snickers bar, two bags of Doritos, and a pack of jolly ranchers. This was all in quarters, nickles, and dimes. When I got to the machine, after I bought my food, a woman came up to the machine and tried to buy a Kit-Kat.  I didn't know her well, but the machine failed.  The Kit-Kat was left hanging on the edge, almost off.  I didn't have any more money, or I would have helped her by purchasing a Kit-Kat myself.  instead, we pounded on the glass and pushed at the machine. I didn't want to risk rocking it because it was very heavy and would be lethal if it fell.  So, we just stood there frustrated, until someone else I didn't know came up and asked about our predicament. I didn't know this fellow, either. He just hit it once it exactly the right spot, and the candy bar fell down. So she got what she ordered, and we were all happy.
363	buying from a vending machine	We were invited to watch a race for "track team", where my daughter was part of it. It was summer, but I was in hurry and  did not realize to bring anything with me. When I reached there, I was already hungry and the people with me too. I usually do not like to get some from outside, but no choice. So I decided to look for vendors or machine. I saw machines, and they were so many. It made me happy. I had $10 with me. The chips were .50 each and cookies were also.50. They had some drinks which was for .50, but big can and bottles. They were very reasonable. So I entered $10 in slot and pressed  buttons for potato chips, Cheetos, Doritos, and Sun chips, total of $5, and then I got  5 bottles of Gatorade, 2 bottles of water, Fanta, Pepsi. Believe me it was enough for us.
364	buying from a vending machine	While waiting for my husband to get out of work, I wait in the employee break room. I'm not really hungry but I have the munchies because it is late at night. I glance over at the vending machine, its bright lights beckon me to the sugar and fat laden calorie rich foods in their shiny cellophane packaging. "eat me" the say in a silently mocking tone. I rub my pant leg to see if i have any change or dollar bills in my pocket. I feel something crunchy in my left pocket....it's a receipt. I rub my other leg and feel some coins in my pocket. "Yes!" just enough to buy that nutty candy bar and salty bag of chips that I really don't need. I plunge my hand into the pocket of my blue jeans and dig out several quarters and a few nickels and dimes. Shoving the change into the machine I press b5 for my first selection, and then I shove several more coins into the coin slot and press d2 for my second selection. each time the coil in the machine spins, effectively pushing the pre-packaged food item off of its cliff int of he bottom of the vending machine where I can reach in a grab my snacks.
365	buying from a vending machine	Billy and Tim love to get bubble gum and candy from a  vending machine at the convenience store at the end of the street where they live. Bobby and Tim usually jump on their bikes and ride down to the little convenience store.  When they get there, they park their bikes, and walk in straight to the vending  machine.  They put in their 10 cent dime into the machine, and press the button next to the candy or gum they want.  The candy pops out  of the bottom of the vending machine, and they usually get two pieces of candy each. They put the candy into their sack they brought with them, and walk around the store to see if they need anything else. Sometimes they also buy a drink for the way back home, especially if it is hot outside. As they leave the store, they wave to the lady at the counter, and thank her for her help.
366	buying from a vending machine	Last Tuesday was another typical workday. Following my daily 1:00 meeting, I was struck with some hunger pains. I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck! My eyes scanned each row and column carefully, paying full attention to the grumbles of my stomach. Finally, I came to E6 - the double twix bar. I felt my hunger pang immediately. Ladies and gentleman, we have a winner. I dug into my pocked and pulled out four quarters, and hastily jammed them into the machine. The twix fell down and not wasting any time I grabbed for it, ready to take a bite and get on with my day.
367	buying from a vending machine	There are a lot of vending machines where I live, and so I buy from them from time to time. Buying from a vending machine is easy when it is working. The last place I bought from a vending machine was at my school, it sells little snacks and drinks so that I don't get hungry. I walked up to the vending machine and put my money in, I had 2 dollars. After I put in the money I looked at all the choices in the machine, there was candy, nuts, crackers, and gum. I decided I wanted some candy and so I looked at what number it was and typed the number into the vending machine's key pad. The vending machine took the candy and dispensed it for me and it fell to the bottom where I was able to pick it up. I then got my change back.
368	buying from a vending machine	I took my little boy downtown to stay in a hotel last week. It was a bit of a staycation in our own city. We explored the city during the day. I packed some food for us to eat in the room for dinner, so we would not have to eat all of our meals out. After we finished eating our dinner, my son wanted a snack. But he did not want any that I brought with us. We decided to go explore for a vending machine. We headed down the hallway and followed the sign to the ice and vending. He could not believe all the choices that were right there in the machine. he could choose from different types of candy, several chip flavors and even pop tarts. He decided on a pack of M&Ms chocolate candy. I showed him how to put the dollar into the slot and he loved seeing it get zipped inside. He pushed the letter and number combo for his snack and watched the spring turn around until his candy dropped. He pushed the door and got his snack. he was very entertained with the process.
369	buying from a vending machine	I am really thirsty and hungry so I need to buy something from the vending machine while shopping. I needed to find a vending machine that both sold soft drinks and food. I found 2 machines side by side that one sold drinks and the other sold food. I looked at the food selections and they had mostly chips and candy. I decided on buying chips. I decided on sour cream and onion chips. They cost $1.00 so I looked in my wallet to make sure I had enough money to buy it. I found 4 quarters and put them in. I pressed the number for the sour cream and onion chips and thankfully they came right out. I then moved on to the drink machine. I really wanted a Dr. Pepper. Thankfully this machine had it. The drinks costs $1.50. I took out a dollar from my wallet and 50 cents. Put the money in the machine and pressed the button for Dr. Pepper. Out came the Dr. Pepper, which was super cold and oh so good. I loved my snacks from the vending machine.
370	buying from a vending machine	I was super hungry between classes.  I had skipped lunch again.  I know that was a bad idea, but I used my lunch period to study.  Now my stomach was grumbling.  I walked down the hall to the vending machine near the office.  I knew there had to be something there that would hold me off till I got home.  I smiled when I saw my favorite snack.  I reached down into my pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.  The machine wouldn't take my dollar though!  A girl passing by traded my dollar for a crisper one.  I tried again.  This time I was successful and the sugary goodness would be all mine!  I pressed the number on the keypad that corresponded with the snack I wanted.  It slowly edged toward me and dropped down.  I reached down to pick up my food.  I thought I deserved it now.
371	buying from a vending machine	This afternoon at work, I got hungry for a snack. I didn't have time to go out to a store or a cafe to buy anything, so I decided to just go to the vending machine. The vending machine had many options to choose from. I decided I did not want anything sweet. I would rather eat something salty. The vending machine had a few different flavors of potato chips, such as original, sour cream and onion, cheddar and sour cream, and barbecue. The vending machine also contained other types of salty snacks such as Sun Chips, Doritos, Cheez Its, Goldfish, and Ritz Bits. I ended up choosing the sour cream and onion potato chips. They cost $1. I inserted a dollar bill, pressed the button that corresponded to the chips I wanted, and watched the machine retrieve the bag of chips for me. I reached into the slot to take the chips. I then enjoyed my snack.
372	going bowling	We decided that Friday night is our bowling night. We already all have our shoes, and don't have to get anxious about renting shoes. Renting bowling shoes gives me nightmares. We arrived at the bowling alley and it was packed, but we already made our reservations, and our lane is nicely prepped for us. All clean.  This alley also has a eatery inside, so the waitress came over to see if we wanted to order anything. We ordered deep fried calamari, onion rings, and cold stouts all around. Waitress came back with out food and drinks pretty quick, in about 15 minutes., I thought it would be longer given how packed it was. This game is not going in my favor. I keep getting splits. and missing the strikes. I need to score some strikes to stay in the game, otherwise, I might have to pay for this entire outing. Woe is me.
373	going bowling	Last week I went bowling to celebrate my friend's birthday. The bowling alley was called Barney's Bowl-o-rama. When we got to the bowling alley we all went up to the counter at the front of the building to pay the fee and get our bowling shoes. I told the attendant my shoe size and he handed over my shoes, then I handed him the money. After we had all gotten our shoes we headed over to the lane that we had been assigned. Everyone put on their shoes and walked over to the ball storage rack to select our bowling balls. I picked a purple ball and my friend picked a pink one. Someone else picked a green one! After everyone had their balls we sat down to figure out the order in which we would bowl. We all wrote our names down on the scorecard and I was assigned to be the person to keep score. We had a great night taking turns bowling, and my friend had the highest score at the end! When we were done, we all turned in our shoes at the counter, said goodbye, and went home to eat dinner.
374	going bowling	My friends and I decided to go bowling a few weeks ago. We met up at the local bowling alley around 6PM and walked inside together. The place was packed, but we managed to find a free lane and sat down. A few of us went up to the counter to pay for a few games for each person. We each then went up to the rental counter to rent some bowling shoes. We each gave the attendant out sizes, and she was able to find the right shoes for each of us on one of the many shelves of shoes. We went back to our lane and sat down to put our shoes on. We then each selected a bowling ball that was the right weight for us. I programmed the computer for our lane so that each of our names showed on the screen above us. We each rolled our balls down the lane, taking two turns at a time. None of us did very well, but we still had fun knocking down pins and catching up. At the end of the games, we returned our shoes and left the bowling alley.
375	going bowling	I live in very small town, and do not have many things to do. One of the sport is bowling. We decided to go for it this weekend. I looked online if they have any deals for group, and i found one. I booked online. We do not have any bowling shoes, so it was extra, but that is OK. I made my kids ready and they wore comfortable attire. The time was from 4 to 8 pm. we got ready about 3:30 pm. we already bought tickets, we did not had to worry about that.Then , we packed some snacks and drinks, if by chance we need them. Then we went to bowling, and reached there 10  minutes earlier. Went exchanges shoes, and got our spot for our group. At first, only 2 sticks were down, but by the second round I made all sticks down on first shot.
376	going bowling	Will wanted to go bowling with his friend Allen, but he didn't have enough money to cover the cost for both him and Allen so he just went alone. Will brought his own ball and when he stepping in the door he could smell that fresh bowling smell. so Will went up to the counter and asked the woman operating the shoe station for a size ten pair of shoes. He laced up his shoes and was ready to go. he saw an open court and he took it. he pressed the new game button and off he went. he saw that the pins were set up in a very specific way but he was ready for that challenge. he rolled the ball so far onto the lane that it knocked out all of the bowling pins and he received a strike! everyone was so amazed. Will did amazing. he kept bowling until the night ended.  he got so tired that he eventually had to call it a night and go home. Will returned the bowling shoes and laced up his old regular ones again taking those shops off was like taking power away from him. Will got back in his car and drove back home.
377	going bowling	My friends and I decide to go bowling this Friday. We decide to call ahead to the bowling alley nearby to reserve our lane at 8 PM on Friday. At Friday 8 PM, we all meet up at the bowling alley and we check in with the worker. He charges us an admission and shoe rental fee. After changing into our new shoes, we head to our lane. The first round took us about 40 minutes to complete. After getting the hang of everything, we complete the second round in only 20 minutes. Everything took us about an hour to complete. At about 9 PM, we decide to leave so we return our shoes and proceed to leave. After saying our goodbye's we go our separate ways. On the way home, I decide that I had a good time bowling so I remind myself to schedule another event very soon.
378	going bowling	I drove the the bowling alley closest to my house. I walked in the door and went to the counter. I told the cashier how many games I would like to play. He asked if I would like to rent bowling shoes. I said yes. The cashier asked my shoe size and I told him I wore a size 9. The cashier went to the back and got the right size shoes. The cashier told me my total and I paid the bill. After I paid, the cashier told me what lane I would be using.  I then went and picked out a bowling ball. I picked a hot pink bowling ball. I then went to the lane that was assigned to me. I put in my name on the computer and began my game. I played 4 games. I then started to get hungry so I went to the snack stand and ordered nachos. After I ate my nachos, I played two more games. I then returned my bowling ball to the proper place, and returned my shoes to the cashier.  The cashier told me to have a nice day and to return soon. I walked out the door and got in my car. I enjoyed spending the afternoon at the bowling alley.
379	going bowling	One day my mother took me out to a bowling alley to spend time with my family and it was a new experience for me since I usually never go out and get socially active with people, But once I was out there long enough and started to loosen up and have fun with my family it was a very fun experience and we all laughed and joked around. We had a team battle where all the girls took on the boys at one point my team being the boys were down and we needed a major comeback and eventually what happened was I was able to bring the boys back into the game. Finally the game came down to one last move, If I got a strike we would win and if I didn't we would lose and surprisingly I was able to get the strike and get my team the win! I had so much fun and I would like to go back one day.
380	going bowling	My friends and I wanted to go bowling. We got in the car and headed to the bowling alley. When we got there, we rented some bowling shoes. The worker sprayed the shoes to make them clean. We put on the shoes and went to our lane. We selected a ball based on the weight since some can be really heavy. Then we took turns throwing the balls and trying to knock the white pins over. Everyone tried to get a strike. Sometimes we missed the pins and the ball would roll into the gutter. Then we got hungry and had some chicken wings from the bowling alley's diner. The glow in the dark round came on and all the lights turned off and everything was glowing. Then, we returned the shoes. Then the music came on and it seemed like a party. Finally, we got sleepy and went home.
381	going bowling	When I was a teenager, I asked a girl if she would like to go bowling with me at a bowling alley.  She said that she would come and asked me what to bring.  I told her she didn't need to bring anything but herself.  I picked her up the next day and we drove to the bowling alley.  We got out of the car and went into the bowling alley.  We bought a couple of games to play and had to rent shoes so that we wouldn't slip on the slippery floor.  We got a couple of decent weighted balls to throw down the alley.  We took turns throwing the ball down the hall and trying to hit the pins on the other side.  She was a lot better than me and scored more points.  After about 18 throws, the game was over and we put our balls away and went to leave.
382	going bowling	One day I went bowling.  Oh what fun bowling was! I threw a 300 round I think. I think that makes me up there with some of the best guys of all time. I guess I will have to come bowl more often. I also like the styles of the bowling alley. The shoes they give you are so nice. I like the old feel and look of them. It is weird thought that so many other people have put their feet into these shoes before. It is alright the shoes are fine. There are also a lot of other shoes to choose from in the store there. You can pick white ones or red ones, and you can even buy new balls there too. Just ask for the service department. Anyway, after I bowled my big round my family took me out to dinner to celebrate. I have nothing but good memories of bowling.
383	going bowling	Last night I went bowling with some girlfriends. We met at the bowling alley and traded in our sandals for some black and white bowling shoes. We laced up the shoes and set up our scorecard with each of our names displayed on the screen. Then one of my friends went to get us all sodas and snacks, and when she got back we started the game. The first game we played just to warm up, so we didn't keep score on the screen. We just took a few turns to get into the groove. Then we got serious and began tracking the score. I won the first game, but then my luck ran out. My friend Sarah won the next two games. Jill did not win any games, but she was a wonderful friend and kept our snacks and drinks filled. Mary Beth was the scorekeeper, though she didn't win either! When the game was over, we traded back for our shoes and drove home.
384	going bowling	I was bored and wanted to play a game. This time I decided I would go bowling. I drove to a bowling alley and payed the worker there to rent some bowling shoes. I put the shoes on to make sure they fit, and was told which lane would be mine to bowl in. I went to my lane with my bowling ball, which was just the right size and not too heavy. I stepped up to the line on the floor and swung the ball under my right shoulder onto the floor. The ball hit the floor and rolled quickly down the center of the lane. A lot of pins were lined up at the end of the lane, and my ball rolled right through the center of them. All the pins fell down and I scored a strike. I was very impressed, and a machine picked the pins back up for me and put them back at the end of the lane. I threw my ball a few more times until the game was over.
385	going bowling	My friend Mary and I went bowling last night.  First we looked up bowling alleys online to see which places were closest.  We picked one that was close to my house.  When we got to the bowling alley it was pretty crowded and we had to wait in line to get a lane.  We bought two games and rented some shoes.  Mary and I entered our names in the computer at the bowling lane so that we could keep score. We both got to pick out balls from a rack.  After we did that, we started bowling.  Mary was able to knock down all the pins a few times so she got strikes.  I usually knocked down just a few at a time.  When the game reached a score of three hundred, Mary won. In between the first game and the second game we bought some food from the counter.  We played one more game and then decided to go home. Mary and I returned our shoes and drove home.
386	going bowling	My wife and I were looking for something to do last night.  We agreed on bowling.  We got in the car and drove to the bowling alley.  We went to the front desk.  The people at the front desk were very nice.  They asked us how many games we wanted to bowl. I wasn't sure, and I looked at my wife.  We decided we would bowl two games.  They asked us what size shoe that we wore.  I told her that I wore a size 11.  The lady got me a size 11 shoe and told us to go to lane 2.  My wife also wanted a drink, so we went to the concession stand.  We bought a soda and went to lane 2.  We both put on our shoes, and then we searched through the balls to find ones we liked.  Once we found our shoes, we began bowling.  I went first, and my wife went after.  We exchanged turns throwing the ball, and we kept each others score.
387	going bowling	On Saturday night, I decided to go bowling with four of my good friends.  When we got to the bowling alley, we paid the cashier.  Then we each got shoes to go bowling in and selected our bowling balls.  We had to try a few balls by picking them up to see how it felt when we held it.  After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.  When that was done, my friend Darren went first. He got a strike!  After Darren, Lori, Ann, and Jeff went.  I went last and got a gutter ball.  I got to go again and I knocked over five pins.  The computer calculated our scores and we went onto the next frame.  At the end, the computer tallied everyone's final scores.
388	going bowling	In the town I used to live in, there usually wasn't much to do as far as activities go. However, when the local bowling alley opened up, that instantly became a popular spot to hang out. It had just about everything from arcade games to bowling to a bar, and they served great food. A usual visit to the bowling alley involved me and either a group of friends or family. We would start things off with an actual game of bowling. We would go over to the counter to check in and get our bowling shoes, followed by getting our lane. While one person set up the game of bowling, the rest of us would go and get the right sized bowling ball that we wanted. When everything was all set, we'd proceed with our game. I usually always came in last, since I'm not very good at bowling. After the game of bowling, we'd go off ad play arcade games and laser tag.
389	going bowling	My friends called me on the phone to ask if I was interested in going bowling with them. I've never experienced what it's like to do so and I wanted to change that, so I agreed to go bowling with them. They went online to book a reservation for our group of five people. We traveled to the place by car and we arrived 10 minutes early. I was so surprised once I saw the setup we had. Everything was glow in the dark. They call it cosmic bowling. We all put on our bowling shoes and then we had to agree on which bowling ball we would use. I was shown how to put my fingers in the holes of the bowling ball. Then I stood behind the foul line which is a piece of colored tape or painted line, aimed for the pin at the front of 10 pins, and rolled the ball down the lane. I knocked 7 pins down on my first try. I had such a great time and told my friends to never come without me,
390	going bowling	Friday night my friend Stacey called me and invited me to go bowling with her and her friends.  I was excited and met them at the bowling alley about ten minutes from my home.  When I got there I rented bowling shoes in my size and put them on over my socks than met with my friends.  I bowled a few times not hitting any of the pins down.  Than to my amazement I aimed for the center and made a strike!  All the pins fell down.  I was very excited.  How could I recreate this again I wondered?  Throughout the evening I kept aiming for the center and made a few more strikes.  Bowling takes a lot of practice but above all it is fun.  It was nice playing with my friends and we made a great evening out of it.  Next time I think I will bring other people with me!
391	going bowling	Yesterday I went bowling with my friends.  They told me that they would meet me at the bowling alley at 3pm.  At 2pm I started getting ready.  By 2:30pm I was ready.  I made sure to bring socks with me, since you will need socks once you get to the bowling alley.  I grabbed my car keys and got in my car.  I drove to the bowling alley.  I listened to a little bit of music on my way.  Once I got to the bowling alley, I parked my car and then walked inside.  Once I was inside, I walked over to my friends.  I asked them how many games they wanted to bowl. They told me that they wanted to play two games.  I walked over to the cashier, I asked how much each game would cost.  The cashier said that each game would cost $3.50.  I wanted two play two games with my friends so I paid $7.00.  Next, I needed to buy shoes so that I could bowl.  I needed special shoes to go bowling so that I wouldn't slip on the floor when I went to bowl.  I asked the cashier for a pair of shoes, size eight and paid four dollars for a pair.  Now I needed a bowling ball.  But I didn't want a bowling ball that would be too heavy.  So I chose one that was only five pounds.  All of my friends came over to our lane where we were bowling.  We all put in our names so that each of us were playing on the same game.  I was first.  Before I started I made sure to put on my bowling shoes, and leave my old shoes by where we were sitting.  Then I took my bowling ball, put my fingers in each hole, aimed, swung my arm back then I let go of the bowl.  The bowling ball flew down the lane.  Out of the ten pins I knocked down six.  Since I didn't knock down all of the pens, I got to go one more time, before it was my friend Sarah's turn to bowl.  I bowled again! This time I knocked down four pins.  Since I knocked down all of the pins I got a spare! By the end of the game I had won the most points out of all of my friends! I won! I returned my bowling shoes and then we all left to go eat dinner!
392	taking a child to bed	After dinner and bath it was time for bedtime. I made sure my kids brushed their teeth and got into their pajamas. After I tucked them snugly into their beds I sat at the edge and picked out their favorite book so we could read a few pages together. We always pass the book back and forth so we all read together. I make sure to help them if they have trouble with the words, so that we can all learn from our mistakes. We usually read a chapter in our bedtime book, but then it is time to close their eyes and drift off to sleep. I make  sure to kiss their heads before I cut off the light and pull the covers up so they stay warm. I always leave the door cracked so they have a little light in case they need to use the bathroom or come get me if they're scared.
393	taking a child to bed	Last night, I watched a movie at home with my daughter. At 8pm when the movie was over, I turned the TV off because it was time to get ready for bed. First we went into the bathroom. I started running the bath while my daughter undressed. I put bubble bath in the water and helped my daughter step into the bathtub. After about 10 minutes, it was time for her to get out of the tub. I gave her a towel to dry off with and helped her get into her pajamas. After she brushed her teeth, we went to the bedroom. I tucked my daughter into the bed so that she was nice and warm and comfortable under the blankets. I sang a lullaby to her and then turned off the lights, leaving only a nightlight on. I said "sweet dreams," and quietly stepped out of the room so she could fall asleep peacefully.
394	taking a child to bed	When I checked the clock, I saw it was getting late. It was time to go to bed. I took my child into the bathroom, and helped him get washed up to go to bed. I made sure he brushed his teeth, washed his face, and washed his hands until he was clean. I made sure he used the toilet, so he wouldn't have to get up during the night. Then, we went to the bedroom to get ready. I helped him out of his day clothes and got him into his pajamas. I helped him get into bed and tucked him in. Then, I read him a bedtime story. We always like reading bedtime stories together, and I always make sure he reads parts himself. Once the story was over, I tucked him in and turned out the light. It wouldn't be long before my son drifted off into sleep.
395	taking a child to bed	Taking my child to bed at night is one of my most special parts of my day every single day. Our bedtime routine is generally the same every day. It begins with a bath. My child loves a bath and will absolutely not go to bed unless he can have his bath. He swims and plays in the bath tub long after he is squeaky clean. Next, he gets into pajamas and brushes his teeth. After that, he comes and holds my hand and tells me he is ready for his books. We both walk hand in hand to my bed, where he sleeps. He picks some books and climbs up into bed. We pull down the covers and both get cozy. I read him two, three or four books until he feels settled and tired enough. Then, I turn out the light and lay next to him as he says his prayers. He then tells me his favorite part of the day. I give him a kiss on the head, I blow a bunch of kisses from the doorway and say "One Million Kisses in the Room". I then leave and he goes to sleep.
396	taking a child to bed	It was almost my daughters bed time, so I began to get her ready for bed. After her bathe, her hair being brushed, as well as her teeth she was ready to put on her pajamas. Once she had put on her pajamas, I walked her to her bedroom. I made sure to leave her night lite one. She wanted me to read her a story before bed, so I did. She listened to the story as I read from the book, helping me turn the page. It was not past her bed time so I told her she needed to go to sleep. I tucked her into her bed and made sure she was not going to fall out and on to the floor, maybe hurting her self. Once she was tucked in, I brought her a glass of water just in case she got thirsty in the middle of the night. I shut the door and let her sleep.
397	taking a child to bed	It was about 8PM and my daughter knew it was her bedtime. I reminded her that it was time to get ready for bed, and to do what she needed to get done beforehand. She went into the bathroom, put the stool out in front of the bathroom sink, and washed her face. After she finished that, I reminded her to brush her teeth. I brushed my teeth alongside with her. I then helped her to floss her teeth. She then ran into her bedroom knowing she was finished getting ready. She untucked the covers and got into bed. I turned on her nightlight and read her a quick bedtime story she picked out from her books on the bookshelf. As I got ready to leave the room, I kissed her goodnight and said I would see her in the morning. I flicked the light switch as I left the room.
398	taking a child to bed	It was family movie night so my husband, myself and our three kids sat on the big comfy purple couch and watched the newest Pixar film, while eating popcorn. Once the movie was over, our two youngest had already been asleep so we each carried one child to their respective beds. We didn't bother to wake them up to brush their teeth ( I feel guilty whenever this happens. ) we covered them up made sure night lights were on and kissed them goodnight. Our son was still up so we took the opportunity to snuggle a bit longer before taking him to brush his teeth. After teeth were brushed we made sure the night light was on and that he was all set for the night. Hugged him real tight gave him a kiss and said goodnight. Five minutes pass. "I need a drink."

399	taking a child to bed	My little daughter was really tired last night.  She had fallen asleep while her mom was feeding her and she was starting to sleep.  I didn't want to wake her up, so I made sure to take her from her mom's arms without making any noise.  She startled a little bit but went back to bed.  After I had her in my arms, I walked slowly to her room that was dark.  I walked up to her crib and made sure that there was nothing in there that she could grab.  With one gentle swoop, I place her down in her crib.  She stretched a little bit, but kept her eyes clothes.  I slowly backed away from her room and made sure not to trip on anything.  As I backed up, I shut the door behind me so that no light would get into my daughter's room as she slept.
400	taking a child to bed	It was getting late and the child had to go to bed because the child had school the next day.  The child needs to get some rest.  First, I took the child to the bathroom, so that the child could brush its teeth and use the toilet.  The child brushes its teeth and uses the bathroom.  After that I took the child to its bedroom so that it could change into its pajamas, so that it could sleep comfortably. The child changed and was ready to sleep.  After that I put the child in the bed and started to read a bedtime story to help the child sleep. I read a story for a little, and the child was getting really sleepy. Then the child wanted some water, so I went to the kitchen and got a cup of water for the child.  In a little while, the child had gone to sleep.
401	taking a child to bed	After a very long Saturday morning, my younger daughter of five and I were relaxing, watching television, when I noticed she started to doze off a bit. I asked if she was ready to lie down and go to bed. She had no issue at all saying yes, and I was a little tired myself, for it was a long week. I extended my hand for her to grab and help up out of the couch and walked her to bed. We made small talk, letting each other know we had a great day together, and looking forward to the next. My daughter jumped right in bed immediately after brushing her teeth and using the restroom one final time for the evening. I opened up the covers for her, fluffed up her pillows, and she lied down. I gave her a kiss, tucked her in, we both said goodnight with a loving smile, and I exited the room, leaving her to her sweet dreams.
402	taking a child to bed	When I last took a young child to bed, I remember it being a difficult experience. I put my little cousin to bed and she is two. This was really tough because she was hyper and did not want to go to sleep. I had to follow a whole structured routine to get her to go to sleep so that she would sleep. This was somewhat difficult, but I first walked upstairs with her and picked out a book, then went to her room and read the book together. When I noticed her start to get tired, I slowly started to stop reading and I left the room. I used the monitor to watch her and noticed that shortly after, she fell asleep. This was not overly difficult, but I had to follow the whole routine to get her to go to sleep. Eventually she fell asleep for the night.
403	taking a child to bed	Every night I must put my son to bed. His name is Alex, and we have the same routine we do each and every night. Last night, we started our bedtime routine by taking a bath. Alex played with his bath toys, and splashed around in the bubbles. He then got dried off and put on his pajamas. Last night he wore his favorite pajamas with Lightning McQueen from the movie "Cars". We went into the bathroom and brushed our teeth, Alex used his green Crayola crayon toothbrush, and got his teeth nice and clean. We then read a bedtime story, last night was Goodnight Fish, which was a book he got when he and his grandparents went to visit the aquarium. After that, he got tucked into his crib, with his favorite blanket, and his favorite stuffed animals: a lamb and a penguin. We sang "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star", and turned off the lights. Like each night, it was a good night.
404	taking a child to bed	I hear moving feet and the cry of a child. Long days I work, steady and always getting into something at work. I come home after my hours, papers left on the ground, TV turned on and an iPod laying on the couch. "Daddy, daddy", the young one shouted, bed times in few minutes, "papa papa", I wanna stay up late!, no time, school in the morning, young life, needs training, only way to earn this is going to sleep early. I get him to brush his teeth, being hard on the one will make me look at him when he gets older. He lays in his bed and I read him a story, it's a goosebump story, night of the living dummy. He loves haunted things at such an early age, I did too, that's how father and son get along. I finish and head out the room and I say goodnight to you son, and so too you too dad.
405	taking a child to bed	I was babysitting for my younger sister once and it was almost time for her to go to sleep. I gave her a bath, helped her brush her teeth, and put her pajamas on her. She was only two so she needed a lot of help. After she was all ready to go to bed, we sat in a chair together to read a couple of bedtime stories. When we were halfway through the the second story, I looked over and noticed that her eyes were starting to close. I shut the book and put it on the bookshelf, and slowly picked my sister up. I brought her over to her bed and laid her down on top of her pillow. I tucked the blankets up over her head, made sure she had her pacifier, and shut all of the lights except her nightlight off as I left and shut the door.
406	taking a child to bed	Every night, I'll take my son Jimmy to bed. First I take him to the bathroom so that he can brush his teeth and wash his face. Then, I take his hand and lead him to bed, he usually is yawning by the time we get there. I make sure he's in his pajamas and then under the covers. I usually read him a story that I let him pick out. The other night he picked out "Where the Wild Things Are" which is also his favorite book. After the story, I'll kiss him goodnight and turn off the light, but usually Jimmy will ask me to turn his nightlight on, but not always as sometimes Jimmy likes to look out his window, but only when the moon is bright and the sky is not cloudy. I will tell him "good night," one last time before I close his door and go to bed myself.
407	taking a child to bed	It is late at night and the sun has gone down, and my kid is sleepy. It is bed time. He is still very little though and needs some help going to bed. I take him to his room and make sure he gets ready before going to sleep. He brushes his teeth and washes his face so he stays clean and healthy every day. Once he is done, he changes into clothes for sleeping so that his other clothes stay clean while he sleeps. He crawls into bed and I pull the covers over him. His head rests on his pillow so he is comfortable and can fall asleep better. He is afraid of the dark like me, so I leave a nightlight on for him in the hallway. A little light at night can help you feel better and more relaxed, but too much light keeps you awake. I tuck him in and say goodnight and let him fall asleep.
408	taking a child to bed	Emily had fallen asleep on the sofa after supper while we were all watching the new movie Dad had rented. The movie had been boring, and Emily had fallen quickly asleep. Mom asked me to try to wake her when the movie was over, but she just snored louder every time I tried to shake her awake. She was such a deep sleeper. Dad sometimes joked that she could sleep through a brass band marching through her room. I believed it now. I had tried very hard to wake her up. I went in and told my mom I couldn't get her up. Mom smiled and hugged me, told me good night, and patted my head. I went into the living room to watch as she kissed Emily on the forehead. She gently slid her arms under Emily's sleeping body, and lifted her up to chest level. I followed her up the stairs and to the room me and Emily shared. Mom pulled the covers down on Emily's bed, and I pulled mine down. Emily woke up just enough to climb down from Mom and snuggle under the covers. Mom kissed us both once more and turned out the light.
409	taking a child to bed	It was night time and it was time to go to bed.  The boy wanted to keep playing.  I told him that after he got ready for bed I would read a story to him.  He dawdled a bit but finally started getting ready for bed.  First of all he had to take a bath.  He splashed in the tub and spilt water all over the floor.  Next he dried off in a big, fluffy blue towel.  Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star Wars toothbrush.  Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then put on his Star Wars pajamas.  His dad and I tucked him into his bed that was made with Star Wars sheets.  He said his prayers.  Next was story time.  I pulled out his favorite book about (you guessed it) Star Wars.  He gradually dozed off dreaming about Anakin Skywalker and a galaxy far, far away.
410	riding on a bus	Yesterday I decided I needed to get to the grocery bus . My car had a flat tire , so I decided to ride the public bus . First , I went online to see the map of the public bus ' because it overwhelms me and I am afraid I will get lost . Then I called the bus hotline and asked the operator how to get where I wanted to go . He helped me figure out what buses I need to take where . Then , I had some lunch , took my backpack and left the house . I had to walk to the bus stop . On the way , I could smell the exhaust from the cars and I already started freaking out . The exhaust is really unhealthy for you . Then I waited for the bus at the stop . After 20 minutes , the bus I needed finally came . The bus came to stop , the doors opened . I stepped onto the bus and gave the driver my money . 
411	riding on a bus	Today , I had to ride the bus home from the market . I walked over to the bus stop to wait for the next bus . It was supposed to arrive in 10 minutes . When the bus pulled up to the bus stop where I was waiting , I stood up and walked over to curb . The bus driver opened the bus doors and I stepped up into the bus . I had to hand my money to the bus driver so that I could ride . Once the driver took my money , I walked down the aisle to find a seat . There were many seats available so I picked one beside an older lady that looked like my grandmother . She was very nice and talked to me while we rode down the street . Once the bus stopped down the street from my house , I got off and walked down the sidewalk to my house . I was very glad to be home . 
412	riding on a bus	I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . Flustered and embarrassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning .
413	riding on a bus	I walked to the bus stop near my home so that I could get to work . I brought along my purse which had my bus card in it so that I could ride without paying cash . It only took a few minutes for the noisy bus to arrive . It stopped at the bus stop and the door opened . The bus driver scanned my bus card and I walked to an empty bench near the middle of the bus . Many other passengers boarded the bus after me and soon the bus was nearly full . Looking around me , I saw a number of senior citizens as well as other young adults . There was even a woman with a sleeping baby sitting on the bus near my bench . I decided to listen to music on my smart phone while I waited for the bus to reach my destination . The bus stopped every few minutes to let other passengers on and off of the bus . After about an hour , the bus stopped at my bus stop and I got up and walked out of the bus , wishing the driver a good day . 
414	riding on a bus	I woke up early in the morning and walked from my house to the road where the bus travels . This is a busy bus route , so there are a lot of buses I can catch at this spot . I waited 10 minutes and saw a bus in the distance coming my way . I waited patiently at the bus stop making sure the bus driver could see I wanted to board . The bus driver stopped the bus and opened the door for me . I had to wait for some other passengers to get off the bus first . I walked up steps into the bus and paid for my trip . There is a machine that collects money and tokens in front of the bus . Luckily , there was a seat available to sit in . I rode the bus for about 10 minutes until we were coming close to my stop . I pulled the string to tell the bus driver I wanted off . I said goodbye and got off the bus and went to my destination . 
415	riding on a bus	I usually do n't take the bus to work but today I decided to give it a try since the bus stop is right across the street from my house . When the bus came I greeted the bus driver with a friendly hello and paid my bus fare . I was lucky enough to find a seat all the way in the back . There was a lot of different people on the bus , some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like I was . I watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks and drop off a few people , but for every person that left a new person got on . I noticed my stop was near so I pushed the strip on the wall that notifies the bus driver my stop is coming up . When he pulled into the next stop I exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 15 minutes I finally reached my destination . 
416	riding on a bus	I took a public bus to get the work this morning . At around 8 am , I left my apartment and walked to the nearest bus stop which was about a 10 minute walk from home . Once I got there , I waited for the bus to arrive along with two other people . After about 15 minutes , an express bus heading to Manhattan arrived . I boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare . I then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free . It was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty . However , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work . Along the way , the bus passed through about 5 different towns while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the George Washington Bridge to get to Manhattan . While getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 20 minute delay . After working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later , we were at the bus terminal on 178th Street . Once we got there , the bus stopped and the driver let us out , whereby I then walked to the office . 
417	riding on a bus	I ride the bus to school everyday . I live in New York City so riding the bus is a common thing . Everyone does it because it is convenient . In our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable . Parking is expensive so public transportation saves us a lot of money . Every morning when I go to school , I wait by the bus stop . The morning bus comes every ten minutes . Once it arrives I board onto the bus and I insert my metro card . The metro card has a balance of money stored inside it . This money is subtracted from the balance every time I ride the bus and insert my metro card . Basically the metro card pays for the bus ride . When I run out of money , I go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance . Riding the bus is annoying sometimes . In the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody . This means I have to stand while holding on to a pole . Sometimes its so crowded that I am sandwiched in between people . If I am lucky , sometimes there will be open seats . Otherwise , I have to stand for 40 minutes . 
418	riding on a bus	Yesterday my car broke down , so I was thinking of how I would get to work . I decided one of the best options would be to take a public bus . Since I 've never taken one before , I went to the city website and looked at a schedule of all the bus times and routes . When I had finally decided on the bus that I needed to take , it was time to put my plan into action . I left my house and walked over to the bus stop . There were a few other people waiting there as well . When the bus arrived I got on and paid the driver the fee , which was $ 1 . I then sat down and waited for the bus to arrive at my destination . It took about 40 minutes to get where I was going , and I arrived safely . I think that overall it was a pleasant experience . 
419	riding on a bus	I needed to get from my house to work , but my car wouldn ' t start . I decided my best option was to take the bus . I walked down the street to the nearest bus stop that would take me close to work . I waited for about five minutes for the bus to come . Once I got on , I put my money in the machine and headed towards the back to find a seat . There were only three open seats so I took one of them and popped in my ear buds to listen to music . I also brought a book along to read so nobody would try to talk to me . The bus made three stops before we got to the corner nearest to my work . Each time people would get off and as they shuffled past would bump into my knees which was really annoying . Then more people would get on and some would find seats , but others had to stand . One person stood directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs . This really annoyed me even more . I don ' t like riding public transportation . Finally we got to my stop and I got out of the bus through the rear doors . 
420	riding on a bus	I needed to get to the craft store , there was a sale ! Unfortunately , husband had the car and he would be gone a while . I decided to take the bus . I made sure I had a couple dollars for the fare and walked to the bus stop . I waited about ten minutes , then the bus came around the corner and stopped at the bench I was sitting . A few people got off the bus and I stepped through the doors onto the bus . I smiled at the bus driver and put the money into the machine to pay for my ride . I took a seat at an open place and looked out the window . The store I was going to was only a few stops away and when I saw we were close , I pulled the cord to signal to the driver I was ready to get off . He stopped at the shopping center and I thanked him for the ride as I stepped onto the pavement . 
421	riding on a bus	I have never had to ride a public bus until 4 years ago when I had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus anywhere I needed to go . The first thing I had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers . This was a little hard to do but once I figured it out it was OK as long as I always kept a schedule with me . I mostly took the bus to work and I only had to worry about catching one bus on the street I lived on and I did not have to sorry about any transfers . The bus ride cost me $ 1.25 and transfers where an additional 50 cents . Many people rode the bus and I meet several nice people on the bus . The bus drivers were always nice and I became friends with several of them . The bus only came once an hour and I had to make sure I did not miss it if I was going to work because then I would be late for work . The bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people . There was usually about a 20 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon . I did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and I was thankful to have the bus available .
422	riding on a bus	Last week , my friend and I rode the public bus into town . We looked at a bus schedule and found the bus stop closest to our homes . We got to the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed to arrive and waited . When it arrived , we got into the line to board . Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus . We had no token , so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . We found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down . We checked our bus schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . When the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our things and prepared to get off . After we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again to take us home . Then we went off to explore the town . 
423	riding on a bus	Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . First thing was to see what bus I needed . I went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city . I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . I grabbed the books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all . 
424	riding on a bus	'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just moved to the city . Daddy took the car to work each day now and her and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . Hannah was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus . Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they were taking was called the Metro . Hannah took her mom 's hand as they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture . It was a picture of a bus . '' `` Does that sign say bus mommy ? '' '' Hannah asked . Her mother replied that it was and it was one of many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and others . They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus came down the street and stopped before them . They waited while a few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped their coins into the busses toll collector . Her mother then asked for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . Hannah asked her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already paid for their ride . Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and handicapped people . Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered the lady did not pay . Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than just one ride . That people who use the bus daily buy them to save money . Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her and mommy . She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . Hannah also noticed people pulling a cord and she figured out why . It made the bus driver stop where ever they would like to get off . Oh how she wanted to pull the string but , mommy told her no . It was only for when you needed it . Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . They stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . Her mom handed the bus driver their transfers . Hannah was excited because this meant the next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new shoes . Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . They even picked up a man in a wheelchair . He drove his wheelchair right up a special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him and his wheelchair in . Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull the cord to make the bus stop . The cord was up high but with a little help from her mom she reached it . Ding ! The bus came to a stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front of them . Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . Hannah waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even more people around the city . 
425	riding on a bus	Every time I have to go to school or work I have to always ride a public bus . I have to make sure that I am by the bus stop in order to catch the bus on time . When I get on the bus , I have to pay the bus fare . I live in a big city , so there 's always a lot of people needing to take the bus . Therefore ; sometimes I am not lucky to find a seat to sit on . In that case , I would have to stand up . Overall , riding a bus is not enjoyable because it tends to be dirty , people are very loud , and it is very crowded . Not to mention , it always smells like urine . My commute is always a long one . I usually stay on the bus for one hour . For that one hour on the bus , I listen to music or play on my cell phone . Eventually , I get to my stop . I get off the bus and reach my destination . 
426	riding on a bus	Last Saturday , I decided to visit a friend in the hospital . I own a car , but it 's been acting up lately , so I needed to take the bus . I set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because it was an amazing day . I walked through my apartment complex 's parking lot to reach the bus stop , where I waited for the bus around 5 minutes . When it came to a stop in front of me , I boarded and put a $ 1 bill and 2 quarters in the fare machine . I selected a seat near the entrance , because it has more space and fewer people . Riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street . Behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class project . In the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to be a dinosaur . I was glad when I finally reached my destination . I pulled the cord signaling that I would need the bus to stop next to the hospital , and got up to exit out the bus 's side door . Fresh air never smelled so good ! 
427	riding on a bus	I live near the city of Santa Cruz and often take the 17X bus to the nearby city of San Jose . It 's possible to get discount fares by paying for multiple rides in advance , but I usually pay cash , five dollars for one-way . I get to my small town 's transit center early on weekday mornings , because the bus fills up quickly , and most good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in downtown Santa Cruz . We wait in line in civilized fashion . Some people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently . But some fumble with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes everyone in line restive . Once on , riders can choose seats grouped around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways . Table seats are premium , since the bus has WiFi and many people bring laptops . Others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks are , just like in high school . My little town is the last stop before highway 17 . The bus whips along amid the pine trees and the yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year . It is pleasant not to have to keep your eyes on the road . Unspoken bus etiquette decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other , but of course some people know each other and chat . Many tap away on their machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride . It ends at San Jose 's train station , where passengers can transfer to the San Francisco train , or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus ride to Fremont to catch the BART mass transit line to Oakland , Richmond , or distant Pittsburg , where the California Delta begins . 
428	riding on a bus	My car was in the shop , so today I decided to commute to school on a public bus . First , I looked up what bus I would need . I found I need to take two buses and transfer in the middle . I started walking to the first bus stop and arrived ten minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive . It came on time , and the bus driver let off the other passengers . I stepped onto the bus and paid the driver the fare . Then I found an open seat by a window and sat down . The ride was around 15 minutes or so . Then the driver announced my stop . I headed out the back doors . Outside , I found a bench and sat down . The next bus came fairly quickly . I hopped on and showed the driver my transfer ticket . This time , the bus was packed , so I found a pole and hung on . The ride was n't too long , however , and soon I was at my final destination . I found my way off the bus and walked over to school . 
429	riding on a bus	Last Friday , my car broke down . I had to get to work Monday , so I decided to ride the public bus since it ran fairly close to my home and work both . Monday morning I got ready early and set off to wait at the bus stop . After sitting for quite a while , the bus finally pulled up . I let others at the stop get on first , then I got on . I asked the bus driver how much the fare was and he told me . I paid the fare by sticking my money in the box near the bus driver , and walked to find a free seat . I found one near the back of the bus , and I sat down . The bus ride was fairly quick and uneventful . I noted that the ride went the same route that I did . Once the bus stopped at the stop near my work , I disembarked . That 's how I rode the public bus .
